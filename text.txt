SQUIRRELS

Walking through the early October woods one dayI came upon a place
where the ground was thickly strewn with very large unopened chestnut
burrsOn examination I found that every burr had been cut square off
with about an inch of the stem adheringand not one had been left on
the treeIt was not accidentthenbut designWhose design A
squirrel sThe fruit was the finest I had ever seen in the woodsand
some wise squirrel had marked it for his ownThe burrs were ripeand
had just begun to divideThe squirrel that had taken all this pains had
evidently reasoned with himself thus Nowthese are extremely fine
chestnutsand I want themif I wait till the burrs open on the tree 
the crows and jays will be sure to carry off a great many of the nuts
before they fallthenafter the wind has rattled out what remain 
there are the micethe chipmunksthe red squirrelsthe raccoonsthe
grouseto say nothing of the boys and the pigsto come in for their
shareso I will forestall events a littleI will cut off the burrs
when they have maturedand a few days of this dry October weather will
cause every one of them to open on the groundI shall be on hand in the
nick of time to gather up my nuts The squirrelof coursehad to take
the chances of a prowler like myself coming alongbut he had fairly
stolen a march on his neighborsAs I proceeded to collect and open the
burrsI was half prepared to hear an audible protest from the trees
aboutfor I constantly fancied myself watched by shy but jealous eyes 
It is an interesting inquiry how the squirrel knew the burrs would open
if left to lie on the ground a few daysPerhaps he did not knowbut
thought the experiment worth trying 


One reasondoubtlesswhy squirrels are so bold and reckless in leaping
through the trees is thatif they miss their hold and fallthey
sustain no injuryEvery species of tree squirrel seems to be capable of
a sort of rudimentary flying at least of making itself into a
parachuteso as to ease or break a fall or a leap from a great height 
The so called flying squirrel does this the most perfectlyIt opens
its furry vestmentsleaps into the airand sails down the steep
incline from the top of one tree to the foot of the next as lightly as a
birdBut other squirrels know the same trickonly their coat skirts
are not so broadOne day my dog treed a red squirrel in a tall hickory
that stood in a meadow on the side of a steep hillTo see what the
squirrel would do when closely pressedI climbed the treeAs I drew
near he took refuge in the topmost branchand thenas I came onhe
boldly leaped into the airspread himself out upon itandwith a
quicktremulous motion of his tail and legsdescended quite slowly and
landed upon the ground thirty feet below meapparently none the worse
for the leapfor he ran with great speed and eluding the dog took
refuge in another tree 

A recent American traveler in Mexico gives a still more striking
instance of this power of squirrels partially to neutralize the force of
gravity when leaping or falling through the airSome boys had caught a
Mexican black squirrelnearly as large as a catIt had escaped from
them onceandwhen pursuedhad taken a leap of sixty feetfrom the
top of a pine tree down upon the roof of a housewithout injuryThis
feat had led the grandmother of one of the boys to declare that the
squirrel was bewitchedand the boys proposed to put the matter to
further test by throwing the squirrel down a precipice six hundred feet
highOur traveler interferedto see that the squirrel had fair play 
The prisoner was conveyed in a pillow slip to the edge of the cliffand
the slip openedso that he might have his choicewhether to remain a
captive or to take the leapHe looked down the awful abyssand then
back and sidewise his eyes glisteninghis form crouchingSeeing no
escape in any other direction he took a flying leap into spaceand
fluttered rather than fell into the abyss belowHis legs began to work
like those of a swimming poodle dogbut quicker and quickerwhile his
tailslightly elevatedspread out like a feather fanA rabbit of the
same weight would have made the trip in about twelve secondsthe
squirrel protracted it for more than half a minute andlanded on a
ledge of limestonewhere we could see him plainly squat on his hind
legs and smooth his ruffled furafter which he made for the creek with
a flourish of his tailtook a good drinkand scampered away into the
willow thicket

The story at first blush seems incrediblebut I have no doubt our red
squirrel would have made the leap safelythen why not the great black
squirrelsince its parachute would be proportionately large

The tails of the squirrels are broad and long and flatnot short and
small like those of gopherschipmunkswoodchucksand other ground
rodentsand when they leap or fall through the air the tail is arched
and rapidly vibratesA squirrel s tailthereforeis something more
than ornamentsomething more than a flagit not only aids him in
flyingbut it serves as a cloakwhich he wraps about him when he
sleeps 

In making the flying leap I have described the animalslegs are widely
extendedtheir bodies broadened and flattenedthe tail stiffened and
slightly curvedand a curious tremulous motion runs through allIt is
very obvious that a deliberate attempt is made to present the broadest
surface possible to the airand I think a red squirrel might leap from
almost any height to the ground without serious injuryOur flying
squirrel is in no proper sense a flyerOn the ground he is more
helpless than a chipmunkbecause less agileHe can only sail or slide
down a steep incline from the top of one tree to the foot of another 
The flying squirrel is active only at nighthence its largesoft eyes 
its soft furand its gentleshrinking waysIt is the gentlest and
most harmless of our rodentsA pair of them for two or three
successive years had their nest behind the blinds of an upper window of
a largeunoccupied country house near meYou could stand in the room
inside and observe the happy family through the window pane against
which their nest pressedThere on the window sill lay a pile of large 
shining chestnutswhich they were evidently holding against a time of
scarcityas the pile did not diminish while I observed themThe nest
was composed of cotton and wool which they filched from a bed in one of
the chambersand it was always a mystery how they got into the room to
obtain itThere seemed to be no other avenue but the chimney flue 


Red and gray squirrels are more or less active all winterthough very
shyandI am inclined to thinkpartially nocturnal in their habits 
Here a gray one has just passed came down that tree and went up this 
there he dug for a beechnutand left the burr on the snowHow did he
know where to dig During an unusually severe winter I have known him to
make long journeys to a barnin a remote fieldwhere wheat was stored 
How did he know there was wheat there In attempting to returnthe
adventurous creature was frequently run down and caught in the deep
snow 

His home is in the trunk of some old birch or maplewith an entrance
far up amid the branchesIn the spring he builds himself a summer house
of small leafy twigs in the top of a neighboring beechwhere the young
are reared and much of the time passedBut the safer retreat in the
maple is not abandonedand both old and young resort thither in the
fallor when danger threatensWhether this temporary residence amid
the branches is for elegance or pleasureor for sanitary reasons or
domestic conveniencethe naturalist has forgotten to mention 

The elegant creatureso cleanly in its habitsso graceful in its
carriageso nimble and daring in its movementsexcites feelings of
admiration akin to those awakened by the birds and the fairer forms of
natureHis passage through the trees is almost a flightIndeedthe
flying squirrel has little or no advantage over himand in speed and
nimbleness cannot compare with him at allIf he miss his footing and
fallhe is sure to catch on the next branchif the connection be
brokenhe leaps recklessly for the nearest spray or limband secures
his holdeven if it be by the aid of his teeth 

His career of frolic and festivity begins in the fallafter the birds
have left us and the holiday spirit of nature has commenced to subside 
How much his presence adds to the pleasure of a saunter in the still
October woodsYou step lightly across the threshold of the forestand
sit down upon the first log or rock to await the signalsIt is so still
that the ear suddenly seems to have acquired new powersand there is no
movement to confuse the eyePresently you hear the rustling of a
branchand see it sway or spring as the squirrel leaps from or to it 
or else you hear a disturbance in the dry leavesand mark one running
upon the groundHe has probably seen the intruderandnot liking his
stealthy movementsdesires to avoid a nearer acquaintanceNow he
mounts a stump to see if the way is clearthen pauses a moment at the
foot of a tree to take his bearingshis tail as he skims along
undulating behind himand adding to the easy grace and dignity of his
movementsOr else you are first advised of his proximity by the
dropping of a false nutor the fragments of the shucks rattling upon
the leavesOragainafter contemplating you a while unobservedand
making up his mind that you are not dangeroushe strikes an attitude on
a branchand commences to quack and barkwith an accompanying movement
of his tailLate in the afternoonwhen the same stillness reignsthe
same scenes are repeatedThere is a black varietyquite rarebut
mating freely with the grayfrom which it seems to be distinguished
only in color 


The red squirrel is more common and less dignified than the grayand
oftener guilty of petty larceny about the barns and grain fieldsHe is
most abundant in mixed oakchestnutand hemlock woodsfrom which he
makes excursions to the fields and orchardsspinning along the tops of
the fenceswhich afford not only convenient lines of communicationbut
a safe retreat if danger threatensHe loves to linger about the
orchardandsitting upright on the topmost stone in the wallor on
the tallest stake in the fencechipping up an apple for the seedshis
tail conforming to the curve of his backhis paws shifting and turning
the applehe is a pretty sightand his brightpert appearance atones
for all the mischief he doesAt homein the woodshe is very
frolicsome and loquaciousThe appearance of anything unusualif after
contemplating it a momenthe concludes it not dangerousexcites his
unbounded mirth and ridiculeand he snickers and chattershardly able
to contain himselfnow darting up the trunk of a tree and squealing in
derisionthen hopping into position on a limb and dancing to the music
of his own cackleand all for your special benefit 

There is something very human in this apparent mirth and mockery of the
squirrelsIt seems to be a sort of ironical laughterand implies
self conscious pride and exultation in the laughter What a ridiculous
thing you areto be sure!he seems to say how clumsy and awkward 
and what a poor show for a tail! Look at melook at me! and he capers
about in his best styleAgainhe would seem to tease you and provoke
your attentionthen suddenly assumes a tone of good naturedchildlike
defiance and derisionThat pretty little impthe chipmunkwill sit on
the stone above his den and defy youas plainly as if he said soto
catch him before he can get into his hole if you can 


A hard winter affects the chipmunks very littlethey are snug and warm
in their burrows in the ground and under the rockswith a bountiful
store of nuts or grainI have heard of nearly a half bushel of
chestnuts being taken from a single denThey usually hole up in
Novemberand do not come out again till March or Aprilunless the
winter is very open and mildGray squirrelswhen they have been partly
domesticated in parks and groves near dwellingsare said to hide their
nuts here and there upon the groundand in winter to dig them up from
beneath the snowalways hitting the spot accurately 

The red squirrel lays up no stores like the provident chipmunkbut
scours about for food in all weathersfeeding upon the seeds in the
cones of the hemlock that still cling to the treeupon sumac bobsand
the seeds of frozen applesI have seen the ground under a wild
apple tree that stood near the woods completely covered with the
 chonkingsof the frozen applesthe work of the squirrels in getting
at the seedsnot an apple had been leftand apparently not a seed had
been lostBut the squirrels in this particular locality evidently got
pretty hard up before springfor they developed a new source of
food supplyA young bushy topped sugar mapleabout forty feet high 
standing beside a stone fence near the woodswas attackedand more
than half denuded of its barkThe object of the squirrels seemed to be
to get at the softwhitemucilaginous substance (cambium layer)
between the bark and the woodThe ground was covered with fragments of
the barkand the whitenaked stems and branches had been scraped by
fine teethWhen the sap starts in the early springthe squirrels add
this to their scanty suppliesThey perforate the bark of the branches
of the maples with their chisel like teethand suck the sweet liquid
as it slowly oozes outIt is not much as foodbut evidently it helps 

I have said the red squirrel does not lay by a store of food for winter
uselike the chipmunk and the wood miceyet in the fall he sometimes
hoards in a tentativetemporary kind of wayI have seen his
savingsbutternuts and black walnutsstuck here and there in saplings
and trees near his nestsometimes carefully inserted in the upright
fork of a limb or twigOne daylate in NovemberI counted a dozen or
more black walnuts put away in this manner in a little grove of locusts 
chestnutsand maples by the roadsideand could but smile at the wise
forethought of the rascally squirrelHis supplies were probably safer
that way than if more elaborately hiddenThey were well distributed 
his eggs were not all in one basketand he could go away from home
without any fear that his storehouse would be broken into in his
absenceThe next weekwhen I passed that waythe nuts were all gone
but twoI saw the squirrel that doubtless laid claim to themon each
occasion 

There is one thing the red squirrel knows unerringly that I do not
(there are probably several other things)that ison which side of the
butternut the meat liesHe always gnaws through the shell so as to
strike the kernel broadsideand thus easily extract itwhile to my
eyes there is no external mark or indicationin the form or appearance
of the nutas there is in the hickory nutby which I can tell whether
the edge or the side of the meat is toward meBut examine any number of
nuts that the squirrels have rifledandas a ruleyou will find they
always drill through the shell at the one spot where the meat will be
most exposedOccasionally one makes a mistakebut not oftenIt stands
them in hand to knowand they do knowDoubtlessif butternuts were a
main source of my foodand I were compelled to gnaw into themI should
learntooon which side my bread was buttered 

The cheeks of the red and gray squirrels are made without pocketsand
whatever they transport is carried in the teethThey are more or less
active all winterbut October and November are their festal months 
Invade some butternut or hickory grove on a frosty October morningand
hear the red squirrel beat thejubaon a horizontal branchIt is a
most lively jigwhat the boys call aregular break down interspersed
with squeals and snickers and derisive laughterThe most noticeable
peculiarity about the vocal part of it is the fact that it is a kind of
duetIn other wordsby some ventriloquial trickshe appears to
accompany himselfas if his voice split upa part forming a low
guttural soundand a part a shrill nasal sound

THE CHIPMUNK


The first chipmunk in March is as sure a token of the spring as the
first bluebird or the first robinand is quite as welcomeSome genial
influence has found him out there in his burrowdeep under the ground 
and waked him upand enticed him forth into the light of dayThe red
squirrel has been more or less active all winterhis track has dotted
the surface of every new fallen snow throughout the seasonBut the
chipmunk retired from view early in Decemberand has passed the
rigorous months in his nestbeside his hoard of nutssome feet
undergroundand hencewhen he emerges in Marchand is seen upon his
little journeys along the fencesor perched upon a log or rock near his
hole in the woodsit is another sign that spring is at handHis store
of nuts may or may not be all consumedit is certain that he is no
sluggardto sleep away these first bright warm days 

Before the first crocus is out of the groundyou may look for the first
chipmunkWhen I hear the little downy woodpecker begin his spring
drummingthen I know the chipmunk is dueHe cannot sleep after that
challenge of the woodpecker reaches his ear 

Apparently the first thing he does on coming forthas soon as he is
sure of himselfis to go courtingSo far as I have observedthe
love making of the chipmunk occurs in MarchA single female will
attract all the males in the vicinityOne early March day I was at work
for several hours near a stone fencewhere a female had apparently
taken up her quartersWhat a train of suitors she had that day! how
they hurried up and downoften giving each other a spiteful slap or
bite as they passedThe young are born in Mayfour or five at a birth 

The chipmunk is quite a solitary creatureI have never known more than
one to occupy the same denApparently no two can agree to live
togetherWhat a cleanpertdappernervous little fellow he is! How
fast his heart beatsas he stands up on the wall by the roadsideand 
with hands spread out upon his breastregards you intently! A movement
of your armand he darts into the wall with a saucy _chip r r_which
has the effect of slamming the door behind him 

On some still day in autumnone of the nutty daysthe woods will
often be pervaded by an undertone of soundproduced by their
multitudinous cluckingas they sit near their densIt is one of the
characteristic sounds of fall 

I was much amused one October in watching a chipmunk carry nuts and
other food into his denHe had made a well defined path from his door
out through the weeds and dry leaves into the territory where his
feeding ground layThe path was a crooked oneit dipped under weeds 
under some largeloosely piled stonesunder a pile of chestnut posts 
and then followed the remains of an old wallGoing and cominghis
motions were like clock workHe always went by spurts and sudden
salliesHe was never for one moment off his guardHe would appear at
the mouth of his denlook quickly abouttake a few leaps to a tussock
of grasspause a breath with one foot raisedslip quickly a few yards
over some dry leavespause again by a stump beside a pathrush across
the path to the pile of loose stonesgo under the first and over the
secondgain the pile of postsmake his way through thatsurvey his
course a half moment from the other side of itand then dart on to some
other coverand presently beyond my rangewhere I think he gathered
acornsas there were no other nut bearing trees than oaks nearIn four
or five minutes I would see him coming backalways keeping rigidly to
the course he took going outpausing at the same spotsdarting over or
under the same objectsclearing at a bound the same pile of leaves 
There was no variation in his manner of proceeding all the time I
observed him 

He was alertcautiousand exceedingly methodicalHe had found safety
in a certain courseand he did not at any time deviate a hair s breadth
from itSomething seemed to say to him all the time Bewarebeware! 
The nervousimpetuous ways of these creatures are no doubt the result
of the life of fear which they lead 

My chipmunk had no companionHe lived all by himself in true hermit
fashionas is usually the case with this squirrelProvident creature
that he isone would think that he would long ago have discovered that
heatand therefore foodis economized by two or three nesting
together 

One day in early springa chipmunk that lived near me met with a
terrible adventurethe memory of which will probably be handed down
through many generations of its familyI was sitting in the
summer house with Nig the cat upon my kneewhen the chipmunk came out
of its den a few feet awayand ran quickly to a pile of chestnut posts
about twenty yards from where I satNig saw itand was off my lap upon
the floor in an instantI spoke sharply to the catwhen she sat down
and folded her paws under herand regarded the squirrelas I thought 
with only a dreamy kind of interestI fancied she thought it a hopeless
case there amid that pile of posts That is not your gameNig I
said so spare yourself any anxiety Just then I was called to the
housewhere I was detained about five minutesAs I returned I met Nig
coming to the house with the chipmunk in her mouthShe had the air of
one who had won a wagerShe carried the chipmunk by the throatand its
body hung limp from her mouthI quickly took the squirrel from herand
reproved her sharplyIt lay in my hand as if deadthough I saw no
marks of the cat s teeth upon itPresently it gasped for its breath 
then again and againI saw that the cat had simply choked itQuickly
the film passed off its eyesits heart began visibly to beatand
slowly the breathing became regularI carried it backand laid it down
in the door of its denIn a moment it crawled or kicked itself inIn
the afternoon I placed a handful of corn thereto express my sympathy 
and as far as possible make amends for Nig s cruel treatment 

Not till four or five days had passed did my little neighbor emerge
again from its denand then only for a momentThat terrible black
monster with the large green yellow eyes it might be still lurking
nearHow the black monster had captured the alert and restless squirrel
so quicklyunder the circumstanceswas a great mystery to meWas not
its eye as sharp as the cat sand its movements as quick Yet cats do
have the secret of catching squirrelsand birdsand micebut I have
never yet had the luck to see it done 

It was not very long before the chipmunk was going to and from her den
as usualthough the dread of the black monster seemed ever before her 
and gave speed and extra alertness to all her movementsIn early summer
four young chipmunks emerged from the denand ran freely aboutThere
was nothing to disturb themforalas! Nig herself was now dead 

One summer day I watched a cat for nearly a half hour trying her arts
upon a chipmunk that sat upon a pile of stoneEvidently her game was to
stalk himShe had cleared half the distanceor about twelve feetthat
separated the chipmunk from a dense Norway sprucewhen I chanced to
become a spectator of the little dramaThere sat the cat crouched low
on the grassher bigyellow eyes fixed upon the chipmunkand there
sat the chipmunk at the mouth of his denmotionlesswith his eyes
fixed upon the catFor a long time neither moved Will the cat bind
him with her fatal spellI thoughtSometimes her head slowly lowered
and her eyes seemed to dilateand I fancied she was about to spring 
But she did notThe distance was too great to be successfully cleared
in one boundThen the squirrel moved nervouslybut kept his eye upon
the enemyThen the cat evidently grew tired and relaxed a little and
looked behind herThen she crouched again and riveted her gaze upon the
squirrelBut the latter would not be hypnotizedhe shifted his
position a few times and finally quickly entered his denwhen the cat
soon slunk away 

In digging his hole it is evident that the chipmunk carries away the
loose soilNever a grain of it is seen in front of his doorThose
pockets of his probably stand him in good stead on such occasionsOnly
in one instance have I seen a pile of earth before the entrance to a
chipmunk s denand that was where the builder had begun his house late
in Novemberand was probably too much hurried to remove this ugly mark
from before his doorI used to pass his place every morning in my walk 
and my eye always fell upon that little pile of redfreshly dug soil 
A little later I used frequently to surprise the squirrel furnishing his
housecarrying in dry leaves of the maple and plane treeHe would
seize a large leaf and with both hands stuff it into his cheek pockets 
and then carry it into his denI saw him on several different days
occupied in this wayI trust he had secured his winter storesthough I
am a little doubtfulHe was hurriedly making himself a new homeand
the cold of December was upon us while he was yet at workIt may be
that he had moved the stores from his old quarterswherever they were 
and again it may be that he had been dispossessed of both his house and
provender by some other chipmunk 

I have been told by a man who says he has seen what he aversthat the
reason why we do not find a pile of fresh earth beside the hole of the
chipmunk is thisIn making his den the workman continues his course
through the soil a foot or more under the surface for several yards 
carrying out the earth in his cheek pouches and dumping it near the
entranceThen he comes to the surface and makes a new hole from
beneathwhich isof coursemany feet from the first holeThis latter
is now closed upand henceforth the new one alone is usedI have no
doubt this is the true explanation 

When nuts or grain are not to be hadthese thrifty little creatures
will find some substitute to help them over the winterTwo chipmunks
near my study were occupied many days in carrying in cherry pits which
they gathered beneath a large cherry tree that stood ten or twelve rods
awayAs Nig was no longer about to molest themthey grew very
fearlessand used to spin up and down the garden path to and from their
source of supplies in a way quite unusual with these timid creatures 
After they had got enough cherry pitsthey gathered the seed of a sugar
maple that stood nearMany of the keys remained upon the tree after the
leaves had fallenand these the squirrels harvestedThey would run
swiftly out upon the ends of the small branchesreach out for the maple
keyssnip off the wingsand deftly slip the nut or samara into their
cheek pocketsDay after day in late autumnI used to see them thus
occupied 

As I have saidI have no evidence that more than one chipmunk occupy
the same denOne March morning after a light fall of snow I saw where
one had come up out of his holewhich was in the side of our path to
the vineyardand after a moment s survey of the surroundings had
started off on his travelsI followed the track to see where he had
goneHe had passed through my woodpilethen under the beehivesthen
around the study and under some spruces and along the slope to the hole
of a friend of hisabout sixty yards from his ownApparently he had
gone in hereand then his friend had come forth with himfor there
were two tracks leading from this doorwayI followed them to a third
humble entrancenot far offwhere the tracks were so numerous that I
lost the trailIt was pleasing to see the evidence of their morning
sociability written there upon the new snow 

One of the enemies of the chipmunkas I discovered latelyis the
weaselI was sitting in the woods one autumn day when I heard a small
cryand a rustling amid the branches of a tree a few rods beyond me 
Looking thither I saw a chipmunk fall through the airand catch on a
limb twenty or more feet from the groundHe appeared to have dropped
from near the top of the tree 

He secured his hold upon the small branch that had luckily intercepted
his falland sat perfectly stillIn a moment more I saw a weaselone
of the smaller red varietiescome down the trunk of the treeand begin
exploring the branches on a level with the chipmunk 

I saw in a moment what had happenedThe weasel had driven the squirrel
from his retreat in the rocks and stones beneathand had pressed him
so closely that he had taken refuge in the top of a treeBut weasels
can climb treestooand this one had tracked the frightened chipmunk
to the topmost branchwhere he had tried to seize himThen the
squirrel hadin horrorlet go his holdscreamedand fallen through
the airtill he struck the branch as just describedNow his
bloodthirsty enemy was looking for him againapparently relying
entirely upon his sense of smell to guide him to the game 

How did the weasel know the squirrel had not fallen clear to the ground
He certainly did knowfor when he reached the same tier of branches he
began exploring themThe chipmunk sat transfixed with fearfrozen with
terrornot twelve feet awayand yet the weasel saw him not 

Round and roundup and downhe went on the branchesexploring them
over and overHow he hurriedlest the trail get cold! How subtle and
cruel and fiendish he looked! His snakelike movementshis tenacityhis
speed!

He seemed baffledhe knew his game was nearbut he could not strike
the spotThe branchupon the extreme end of which the squirrel sat 
ran out and up from the tree seven or eight feetand thenturning a
sharp elbowswept down and out at right angles with its first course 

The weasel would pause each time at this elbow and turn backIt seemed
as if he knew that particular branch held his preyand yet its
crookedness each time threw him outHe would not give it upbut went
over his course again and again 

One can fancy the feelings of the chipmunksitting there in plain view
a few feet awaywatching his deadly enemy hunting for the clueHow his
little heart must have fairly stood still each time the fatal branch was
struck! Probably as a last resort he would again have let go his hold
and fallen to the groundwhere he might have eluded his enemy a while
longer 

In the course of five or six minutes the weasel gave over the search 
and ran hurriedly down the tree to the groundThe chipmunk remained
motionless for a long timethen he stirred a little as if hope were
revivingThen he looked nervously about himthen he had recovered
himself so far as to change his positionPresently he began to move
cautiously along the branch to the bole of the treethenafter a few
momentsdelayhe plucked up courage to descend to the groundwhere I
hope no weasel has disturbed him since 

One season a chipmunk had his den in the side of the terrace above my
gardenand spent the mornings laying in a store of corn which he stole
from a field ten or twelve rods awayIn traversing about half this
distancethe little poacher was exposedthe first cover on the way
from his den was a large maplewhere he always brought up and took a
survey of the sceneI would see him spinning along toward the maple 
then from it by an easy stage to the fence adjoining the cornthen back
again with his bootyOne morning I paused to watch him more at my
leisureHe came up out of his retreat and cocked himself up to see what
my motions meantHis forepaws were clasped to his breast precisely as
if they had been handsand the tips of the fingers thrust into his vest
pocketsHaving satisfied himself with reference to mehe sped on
toward the treeHe had nearly reached itwhen he turned tail and
rushed for his hole with the greatest precipitationAs he neared itI
saw some bluish object in the air closing in upon him with the speed of
an arrowandas he vanished withina shrike brought up in front of
the spotand with spread wings and tail stood hovering a momentand 
looking inthen turned and went awayApparently it was a narrow escape
for the chipmunkandI venture to sayhe stole no more corn that
morningThe shrike is said to catch micebut it is not known to attack
squirrelsThe bird certainly could not have strangled the chipmunkand
I am curious to know what would have been the result had he overtaken
himProbably it was only a kind of brag on his parta bold dash where
no risk was runHe simulated the hawkthe squirrel s real enemyand
no doubt enjoyed the joke 


The sylvan folk seem to know when you are on a peaceful missionand are
less afraid than usualDid not that marmot to day guess my errand did
not concern him as he saw me approach there from his cover in the
bushes Butwhen he saw me pause and deliberately seat myself on the
stone wall immediately over his holehis confidence was much shakenHe
apparently deliberated awhilefor I heard the leaves rustle as if he
were making up his mindwhen he suddenly broke cover and came for his
hole full tiltAny other animal would have taken to his heels and fled 
but a woodchuck s heels do not amount to much for speedand he feels
his only safety is in his holeOn he came in the most obstinate and
determined mannerand I dare say if I had sat down in his hole would
have attacked me unhesitatinglyThis I did not give him a chance to
doand he whipped into his den beneath me with a defiant snortFarther
ona saucy chipmunk presumed upon my harmless character to an unwonted
degree alsoI had paused to bathe my hands and face in a little trout
brookand had set a tin cupwhich I had partly filled with
strawberries as I crossed the fieldon a stone at my feetwhen along
came the chipmunk as confidently as if he knew precisely where he was
goingandperfectly oblivious of my presencecocked himself up on the
rim of the cup and proceeded to eat my choicest berriesI remained
motionless and observed himHe had eaten but two when the thought
seemed to occur to him that he might be doing betterand he began to
fill his pocketsTwofoursixeight of my berries quickly
disappearedand the cheeks of the little vagabond swelledBut all the
time he kept eatingthat not a moment might be lostThen he hopped off
the cupand went skipping from stone to stone till the brook was
passedwhen he disappeared in the woodsIn two or three minutes he was
back againand went to stuffing himself as beforethen he disappeared
a second timeand I imagined told a friend of hisfor in a moment or
two along came a bobtailed chipmunkas if in search of somethingand
passed upand downand aroundbut did not quite hit the spot 
Shortlythe first returned a third timeand had now grown a little
fastidiousfor he began to sort over my berriesand to bite into them 
as if to taste their qualityHe was not long in loading uphowever 
and in making off againBut I had now got tired of the jokeand my
berries were appreciably diminishingso I moved awayWhat was most
curious about the proceeding wasthat the little poacher took different
directions each timeand returned from different waysWas this to
elude pursuitor was he distributing the fruit to his friends and
neighbors aboutastonishing them with strawberries for lunch

On another occasion I was much amused by three chipmunkswho seemed to
be engaged in some kind of gameIt looked very much as if they were
playing tagRound and round they would gofirst one taking the lead 
then anotherall good natured and gleeful as schoolboysThere is one
thing about a chipmunk that is peculiarhe is never more than one jump
from homeMake a dive at him anywhere and in he goesHe knows where
the hole iseven when it is covered up with leavesThere is no doubt 
alsothat he has his own sense of humor and funas what squirrel has
not I have watched two red squirrels for a half hour coursing through
the large trees by the roadside where branches interlockedand engaged
in a game of tag as obviously as two boysAs soon as the pursuer had
come up with the pursuedand actually touched himthe palm was his 
and away he would gotaxing his wits and his speed to the utmost to
elude his fellow 

I have observed that any unusual disturbance in the woodsnear where
the chipmunk has his denwill cause him to shift his quartersOne
Octoberfor many successive daysI saw one carrying into his hole
buckwheat which he had stolen from a near fieldThe hole was only a few
rods from where we were getting out stoneand as our work progressed 
and the racket and uproar increasedthe chipmunk became alarmedHe
ceased carrying inand after much hesitating and darting aboutand
some prolonged absenceshe began to carry outhe had determined to
moveif the mountain fellheat leastwould be away in timeSoby
mouthfuls or cheekfulsthe grain was transferred to a new placeHe did
not make abeeto get it donebut carried it all himselfoccupying
several daysand making a trip about every ten minutes

THE WOODCHUCK


In the Middle and Eastern States our woodchuck takes the placein some
respectsof the English rabbitburrowing in every hillside and under
every stone wall and jutting ledge and large boulderwhence it makes
raids upon the grass and clover and sometimes upon the garden
vegetablesIt is quite solitary in its habitsseldom more than one
inhabiting the same denunless it be a mother and her youngIt is not
now so much a _wood_ chuck as a _field_ chuckOccasionallyhowever 
one seems to prefer the woodsand is not seduced by the sunny slopes
and the succulent grassbut feedsas did his fathers before himupon
roots and twigsthe bark of young treesand upon various wood plants 

One summer dayas I was swimming across a broaddeep pool in the creek
in a secluded place in the woodsI saw one of these sylvan chucks amid
the rocks but a few feet from the edge of the water where I proposed to
touchHe saw my approachbut doubtless took me for some water fowl 
or for some cousin of his of the muskrat tribefor he went on with his
feedingand regarded me not till I paused within ten feet of him and
lifted myself upThen he did not know mehavingperhapsnever seen
Adam in his simplicitybut he twisted his nose around to catch my
scentand the moment he had done so he sprang like a jumping jack and
rushed into his den with the utmost precipitation 

The woodchuck is the true serf among our animalshe belongs to the
soiland savors of itHe is of the earthearthyThere is generally a
decided odor about his dens and lurking placesbut it is not at all
disagreeable in the clover scented airand his shrill whistleas he
takes to his hole or defies the farm dog from the interior of the stone
wallis a pleasant summer soundIn form and movement the woodchuck is
not captivatingHis body is heavy and flabbyIndeedsuch a flaccid 
fluidpouchy carcass I have never before seenIt has absolutely no
muscular tension or rigiditybut is as baggy and shaky as a skin filled
with waterThe legs of the woodchuck are short and stoutand made for
digging rather than runningThe latter operation he performs by short
leapshis belly scarcely clearing the groundFor a short distance he
can make very good timebut he seldom trusts himself far from his hole 
andwhen surprised in that predicamentmakes little effort to escape 
butgrating his teethlooks the danger squarely in the face 

I knew a farmer in New York who had a very large bobtailed churn dog by
the name of CuffThe farmer kept a large dairy and made a great deal of
butterand it was the business of Cuff to spend nearly the half of each
summer day treading the endless round of the churning machineDuring
the remainder of the day he had plenty of time to sleep and restand
sit on his hips and survey the landscapeOne daysitting thushe
discovered a woodchuck about forty rods from the houseon a steep
sidehillfeeding about near his holewhich was beneath a large rock 
The old dogforgetting his stiffnessand remembering the fun he had
had with woodchucks in his earlier daysstarted off at his highest
speedvainly hoping to catch this one before he could get to his hole 
But the woodchuckseeing the dog come laboring up the hillsprang to
the mouth of his denandwhen his pursuer was only a few rods off 
whistled tauntingly and went inThis occurred several timesthe old
dog marching up the hilland then marching down againhaving had his
labor for his pains 

I suspect that he revolved the subject in his mind while revolving the
great wheel of the churning machineand that some turn or other brought
him a happy thoughtfor next time he showed himself a strategist 
Instead of giving chase to the woodchuckwhen first discoveredhe
crouched down to the groundandresting his head on his pawswatched
himThe woodchuck kept working away from his holelured by the tender
cloverbutnot unmindful of his safetylifted himself up on his
haunches every few moments and surveyed the approachesPresentlyafter
the woodchuck had let himself down from one of these attitudes of
observation and resumed his feedingCuff started swiftly but stealthily
up the hillprecisely in the attitude of a cat when she is stalking a
birdWhen the woodchuck rose up againCuff was perfectly motionless
and half hid by the grassWhen he again resumed his cloverCuff sped
up the hill as beforethis time crossing a fencebut in a low place 
and so nimbly that he was not discoveredAgain the woodchuck was on the
outlookagain Cuff was motionless and hugging the groundAs the dog
neared his victim he was partially hidden by a swell in the earthbut
still the woodchuck from his outlook reportedAll right when Cuff 
having not twice as far to run as the chuckthrew all stealthiness
aside and rushed directly for the holeAt that moment the woodchuck
discovered his dangerandseeing that it was a race for lifeleaped
as I never saw marmot leap beforeBut he was two seconds too latehis
retreat was cut offand the powerful jaws of the old dog closed upon
him 

The next season Cuff tried the same tactics again with like successbut
when the third woodchuck had taken up his abode at the fatal holethe
old churner s wits and strength had begun to fail himand he was
baffled in each attempt to capture the animal 

The woodchuck usually burrows on a sidehillThis enables him to guard
against being drowned outby making the termination of the hole higher
than the entranceHe digs in slantingly for about two or three feet 
then makes a sharp upward turn and keeps nearly parallel with the
surface of the ground for a distance of eight or ten feet farther 
according to the gradeHere he makes his nest and passes the winter 
holing up in October or November and coming out again in March or April 
This is a long sleepand is rendered possible only by the amount of fat
with which the system has become stored during the summerThe fire of
life still burnsbut very faintly and slowlyas with the draughts all
closed and the ashes heaped upRespiration is continuedbut at longer
intervalsand all the vital processes are nearly at a standstillDig
one out during hibernation (Audubon did so)and you find it a mere
inanimate ballthat suffers itself to be moved and rolled about without
showing signs of awakeningBut bring it in by the fireand it
presently unrolls and opens its eyesand crawls feebly aboutand if
left to itself will seek some dark hole or cornerroll itself up again 
and resume its former condition

THE RABBIT AND THE HARE


With us the hare is of the remote northern woodsthe rabbit is of the
fields and bushy margins of the woodsOne retreats before man and
civilizationthe other follows in their wakeThe rabbit is now common
in parts of our State (New York) where in my boyhood only the hare was
foundThe rabbit evidently loves to be neighbor to man and profits by
itNearly every winter one takes up her abode under my study floorand
when the snow is deep and the weather is cold she usually finds every
night a couple of sweet apples on her thresholdI suppose she thinks
they grow thereor are blown there by the wind like the snowAt such
times she does not leave her retreatthe apples are good fortune
enoughIf I neglect to put them therein the morning I see where she
has gone forth over the lawn looking for themor for some other food 

I wonder if that fox chanced to catch a glimpse of her the other night
when he stealthily leaped over the fence near by and walked along
between the study and the house How clearly one could read that it was
not a little dog that had passed there! There was something furtive in
the trackit shied off away from the house and around itas if eyeing
it suspiciouslyand then it had the caution and deliberation of the
fox boldboldbut not too boldwariness was in every footprintIf
it had been a little dog that had chanced to wander that waywhen he
crossed my path he would have followed it up to the barn and have gone
smelling around for a bonebut this sharpcautious track held straight
across all otherskeeping five or six rods from the houseup the hill 
across the highway toward a neighboring farmsteadwith its nose in the
airand its eye and ear alertso to speak 

One summer a wild rabbit came up within a few feet of my neighbor s
housescooped out a little place in the turfand reared her family
thereI suppose she felt more secure from prowling cats and dogs than
in the garden or vineyardMy neighbor took me out to let me into her
secretHe pointed down to the ground a few feet in front of us and
said There it is I looked and saw nothing but the newly mown turf
with one spot the size of my two hands where the grass was apparently
dead I see no rabbit nor any signs of a rabbit I repliedHe
stooped to this dry spot and lifted up a little blanket or carpet of
matted dry grass and revealed one of the prettiest sights I had ever
seenand the only one of the kind I had ever looked upon!four or five
little rabbits half the size of chipmunkscuddled down in a dry
fur lined nestThey did not move or winkand their ears were pressed
down close to their headsMy neighbor let the coverlet fall backand
they were hidden again as by magic 

They had been discovered a few days before when the lawn was mownand
oneas it sprang out from the nestwas killed by the mowerwho
mistook it for a young ratThe rest of them fled and disappeared
through the grassbut the next morning they were back in the nest 
where they remained for several days longerOnly at nightso far as
was observeddid the mother visit and nurse them 

There was no opening into the nestthe mat of dried grass covered it
completelyso that the motherin her visits to themmust have lifted
it up and crept beneathIt was a very pretty and cunning deviceOne
might have stepped upon it in his walkbut surely his eyes alone would
never have penetrated the secretI am told by men wise in the lore of
the fields and woods that the rabbit always covers her nest and young
with a little blanketusually made of fur plucked from her own breast 

The rabbit seems to suffer very little from the deep snows and severe
cold of winterThe deeper the snowthe nearer she is brought to the
tops of the tender bushes and shootsI see in my walks where she has
cropped the tops of the smallbushysoft maplescutting them
slantingly as you would with a knifeand quite as smoothlyIndeedthe
mark was so like that of a knife thatnotwithstanding the tracksit
was only after the closest scrutiny that I was convinced it was the
sharpchisel like teeth of the rabbitShe leaves no chipsand
apparently makes clean work of every twig she cuts off 

The hare is nocturnal in its habitsand though a very lively creature
at nightwith regular courses and run ways through the woodis
entirely quiet by dayTimid as he ishe makes little effort to conceal
himselfusually squatting beside a logstumpor treeand seeming to
avoid rocks and ledges where he might be partially housed from the cold
and the snowbut where alsoand this consideration undoubtedly
determines his choicehe would be more apt to fall a prey to his
enemiesIn thisas well as in many other respectshe differs from the
rabbit properHe never burrows in the groundor takes refuge in a den
or holewhen pursuedIf caught in the open fieldshe is much confused
and easily overtaken by the dogbut in the woodshe leaves his enemy
at a boundIn summerwhen first disturbedhe beats the ground
violently with his feetby which means he would express to you his
surprise or displeasureit is a dumb way he has of scoldingAfter
leaping a few yardshe pauses an instantas if to determine the degree
of dangerand then hurries away with a much lighter tread 

His feet are like great padsand his track in the snow has little of
the sharparticulated expression of Reynard sor of animals that climb
or digYet it is very prettylike all the restand tells its own
taleThere is nothing bold or vicious or vulpine in itand his timid 
harmless character is published at every leapHe abounds in dense
woodspreferring localities filled with a small undergrowth of beech
and birchupon the bark of which he feedsNature is rather partial to
himand matches his extreme local habits and character with a suit that
corresponds with his surroundings reddish gray in summer and white in
winter

THE MUSKRAT


It sometimes looks as if the muskrat were weather wise and could
forecast the coming seasonI doubt if a long series of observations
would bear out the truth of this remarkyet I have noticed that in his
nest building he sometimes hits the mark with surprising accuracy 

In the fall ofI observed that he built unusually high and massive
nestsI noticed them in several different localitiesIn a shallow 
sluggish pond by the roadsidewhich I used to pass daily in my walk 
two nests were in process of construction throughout the month of
NovemberThe builders worked only at nightand I could see each day
that the work had visibly advancedWhen there was a slight skim of ice
over the pondthis was broken up about the nestswith trails through
it in different directions where the material had been broughtThe
houses were placed a little to one side of the main channeland were
constructed entirely of a species of coarse wild grass that grew all
aboutSo far as I could seefrom first to last they were solid masses
of grassas if the interior cavity or nest was to be excavated
afterwardas doubtless it wasAs they emerged from the pond they
gradually assumed the shape of a miniature mountainvery bold and steep
on the south sideand running down a long gentle grade to the surface
of the water on the northOne could see that the little architect
hauled all his material up this easy slopeand thrust it out boldly
around the other sideEvery mouthful was distinctly definedAfter they
were two feet or more above the waterI expected each day to see that
the finishing stroke had been given and the work brought to a closeBut
higher yetsaid the builder 

December drew nearthe cold became threateningand I was apprehensive
that winter would suddenly shut down upon those unfinished nestsBut
the wise muskrats seemed to know better than I didFinallyabout the
 th of Decemberthe nests assumed completionthe northern incline was
absorbed or carried upand each structure became a strong massive cone 
three or four feet highthe largest nest of the kind I had ever seen 
 Does it mean a severe winterI inquiredAn old farmer said it meant
 high water and he was right onceat leastfor in a few days
afterward we had the heaviest rainfall known in this section for half a
centuryThe creeks rose to an almost unprecedented heightThe sluggish
pond became a seethingturbulent watercoursegradually the angry
element crept up the sides of these lake dwellingstillwhen the rain
ceasedabout four o clockthey showed above the flood no larger than a
man s hatDuring the night the channel shifted till the main current
swept over themand next day not a vestige of the nests was to be seen 
they had gone downstreamas had many other dwellings of a less
temporary characterThe rats had built wiselyand would have been
perfectly secure against any ordinary high waterbut who can foresee a
flood The oldest traditions of their race did not run back to the time
of such a visitation 

Nearly a week afterward another dwelling was begunwell away from the
treacherous channelbut the architects did not work at it with much
heartthe material was very scarcethe ice hinderedand before the
basement story was fairly finishedwinter had the pond under his lock
and key 

In other localities I noticed that where the nests were placed on the
banks of streamsthey were made secure against the floods by being
built amid a small clump of bushesWhen the fall ofcamethe
muskrats were very tardy about beginning their houselaying the
cornerstoneor the corner sodabout Decemberand continuing the
work slowly and indifferentlyOn the th of the month the nest was not
yet finished Maybe I said this indicates a mild winter andsure
enoughthe season was one of the mildest known for many yearsThe rats
had little use for their house 



Againin the fall of while the weather wise were wagging their
headssome forecasting a mildsome a severe winterI watched with
interest for a sign from my muskratsAbout Novembera month earlier
than the previous yearthey began their nestand worked at it with a
willThey appeared to have just got tidings of what was comingIf I
had taken the hint so palpably givenmy celery would not have been
frozen up in the groundand my apples caught in unprotected places 
When the cold wave struck usabout November my four leggedI
told you so shad nearly completed their dwellingit lacked only the
ridge boardso to speakit needed a littletopping out to give it a
finished lookBut this it never gotThe winter had come to stayand
it waxed more and more severetill the unprecedented cold of the last
days of December must have astonished even the wise muskrats in their
snug retreatI approached their nest at this timea white mound upon
the whitedeeply frozen surface of the pondand wondered if there was
any life in that apparent sepulchreI thrust my walking stick sharply
into itwhen there was a rustle and a splash into the wateras the
occupant made his escapeWhat a damp basement that house hasI
thoughtand what a pity to rout a peaceful neighbor out of his bed in
this weatherand into such a state of things as this! But water does
not wet the muskrathis fur is charmedand not a drop penetrates it 

Where the ground is favorablethe muskrats do not build these
mound like nestsbut burrow into the bank a long distanceand
establish their winter quarters there 

The muskrat does not hibernate like some rodentsbut is pretty active
all winterIn December I noticed in my walk where they had made
excursions of a few yards to an orchard for frozen applesOne day 
along a little streamI saw a mink track amid those of the muskrat 
following it upI presently came to blood and other marks of strife
upon the snow beside a stone wallLooking in between the stonesI
found the carcass of the luckless ratwith its head and neck eaten
awayThe mink had made a meal of him

THE SKUNK


In February a new track appears upon the snowslender and delicate 
about a third larger than that of the gray squirrelindicating no haste
or speedbuton the contrarydenoting the most imperturbable ease and
leisurethe footprints so close together that the trail appears like a
chain of curiously carved linksSir _Mephitis mephitica_orin plain
Englishthe skunkhas waked up from his six weeksnapand come out
into society againHe is a nocturnal travelervery bold and impudent 
coming quite up to the barn and outbuildingsand sometimes taking up
his quarters for the season under the haymowThere is no such word as
hurry in his dictionaryas you may see by his path upon the snowHe
has a very sneakinginsinuating wayand goes creeping about the fields
and woodsnever once in a perceptible degree altering his gaitandif
a fence crosses his coursesteers for a break or opening to avoid
climbingHe is too indolent even to dig his own holebut appropriates
that of a woodchuckor hunts out a crevice in the rocksfrom which he
extends his rambling in all directionspreferring dampthawy weather 
He has very little discretion or cunningand holds a trap in utter
contemptstepping into it as soon as beside itrelying implicitly for
defense against all forms of danger upon the unsavory punishment he is
capable of inflictingHe is quite indifferent to both man and beast 
and will not hurry himself to get out of the way of eitherWalking
through the summer fields at twilightI have come near stepping upon
himand was much the more disturbed of the two 

He has a secret to keep and knows itand is careful not to betray
himself until he can do so with the most telling effectI have known
him to preserve his serenity even when caught in a steel trapand look
the very picture of injured innocencemanoeuvring carefully and
deliberately to extricate his foot from the grasp of the naughty jaws 
Do not by any means take pity on himand lend a helping hand!

How pretty his face and head! How fine and delicate his teethlike a
weasel s or a cat s! When about a third grownhe looks so well that one
covets him for a petMy neighbor once captured a young onewhich he
kept over a yearand which afforded him much amusementHe named it
Mahomet 

No animal is more cleanly in its habits than heHe is not an awkward
boy who cuts his own face with his whipand neither his flesh nor his
fur hints the weapon with which he is armedThe most silent creature
known to mehe makes no soundso far as I have observedsave a
diffuseimpatient noiselike that produced by beating your hand with a
whisk broomwhen the farm dog has discovered his retreat in the stone
fenceHe renders himself obnoxious to the farmer by his partiality for
henseggs and young poultryHe is a confirmed epicureand at
plundering hen roosts an expertNot the full grown fowls are his
victimsbut the youngest and most tenderAt night Mother Hen receives
under her maternal wings a dozen newly hatched chickensand with much
pride and satisfaction feels them all safely tucked away in her
feathersIn the morning she is walking about disconsolatelyattended
by only two or three of all that pretty broodWhat has happened Where
are they gone That pickpocketSir Mephitiscould solve the mystery 
Quietly has he approachedunder cover of darknessand one by one
relieved her of her precious chargeLook closelyand you will see
their little yellow legs and beaksor part of a mangled formlying
about on the groundOrbefore the hen has hatchedhe may find her
outandby the same sleight of handremove every eggleaving only
the empty blood stained shells to witness against himThe birds 
especially the ground builderssuffer in like manner from his
plundering propensities 

The secretion upon which he relies for defenseand which is the chief
source of his unpopularitywhile it affords good reasons against
cultivating him as a petand mars his attractiveness as gameis by no
means the greatest indignity that can be offered to a noseIt is a
rankliving smelland has none of the sickening qualities of disease
or putrefactionIndeedI think a good smeller will enjoy its most
refined intensityIt approaches the sublimeand makes the nose tingle 
It is tonic and bracingandI can readily believehas rare medicinal
qualitiesI do not recommend its use as eye waterthough an old farmer
assures me it has undoubted virtues when thus appliedHearingone
nighta disturbance among his henshe rushed suddenly out to catch the
thiefwhen Sir Mephitistaken by surpriseand no doubt much annoyed
at being interrupteddischarged the vials of his wrath full in the
farmer s faceand with such admirable effect thatfor a few moments 
he was completely blindedand powerless to revenge himself upon the
roguewho embraced the opportunity to make good his escapebut he
declared that afterwards his eyes felt as if purged by fireand his
sight was much clearer 

The skunk has perfect confidence in the efficacy of his weaponLate one
March afternoon in my walkI saw one coming down through a field toward
the highwayI thought I would intercept him and turn him backI
advanced to within fifteen or twenty yards of himandas he did not
check his coursejudged it prudent to check mineOn he came toward me 
with the most jaunty and frolicsome airwaving his tail high above his
head and challenging me to the combatI retreated and he pursuedtill
I finally left him master of the field

THE FOX


It has been many a long day since I heard a fox barkbut in my youth
among the Catskills I often heard the soundespecially of a still
moonlight night in midwinterPerhaps it was more a cry than a barknot
continuous like the baying of a dogbut uttered at intervalsOne feels
that the creature is trying to barkbut has not yet learned the trick
of itBut it is a wildweird soundI would get up any night to hear
it againI used to listen for it when a boystanding in front of my
father s housePresently I would hear one away up on the shoulder of
the mountainand I imagined I could almost see him sitting there in his
furs upon the illuminated surface and looking down in my directionAs I
listenedmaybe one would answer him from behind the woods in the
valleya fitting sound amid the ghostly winter hills 

The red fox was the only species that abounded in this localityOn my
way to school in the morningafter a fresh fall of snowI would see
at many points where he had crossed the roadHere he had leisurely
passed within rifle range of the houseevidently reconnoitring the
premises with an eye to the hen roostThat clearsharp track there
was no mistaking it for the clumsy footprint of a little dogAll his
wildness and agility were photographed in itHere he had taken fright 
or suddenly recollected an engagementand in longgraceful leaps 
barely touching the fencehad gone careering up the hill as fleet as
the wind 

The usual gait of the foxunlike that of the dogisat night at
leasta walkOn such occasions he is in quest of game and he goes
through the woods and fields in an alertstealthy mannerstepping
about a foot at a timeand keeping his eyes and ears open 

The wildbuoyant creaturehow beautiful he is! I had often seen his
dead carcassand at a distance had witnessed the hounds drive him
across the upper fieldsbut the thrill and excitement of meeting him in
his wild freedom in the woods were unknown to me tillone cold winter
daydrawn thither by the baying of a houndI stood near the summit of
the mountainwaiting a renewal of the soundthat I might determine the
course of the dog and choose my position stimulated by the ambition of
all young Nimrods to bag some notable gameLong I waitedand
patientlytillchilled and benumbedI was about to turn backwhen 
hearing a slight noiseI looked up and beheld a most superb foxloping
along with inimitable grace and easeevidently disturbedbut not
pursued by the houndand so absorbed in his private meditations that he
failed to see methough I stood transfixed with amazement and
admirationnot ten yards distantI took his measure at a glance a
large malewith dark legsand massive tail tipped with white a most
magnificent creaturebut so astonished and fascinated was I by this
sudden appearance and matchless beautythat not till I had caught the
last glimpse of himas he disappeared over a knolldid I awake to my
duty as a sportsmanand realize what an opportunity to distinguish
myself I had unconsciously let slipI clutched my gunhalf angrilyas
if it was to blameand went home out of humor with myself and all
fox kindBut I have since thought better of the experienceand
concluded that I bagged the game after allthe best part of itand
fleeced Reynard of something more valuable than his furwithout his
knowledge 

This is thoroughly a winter sound this voice of the hound upon the
mountain and one that is music to many earsThe long trumpet like
bayheard for a mile or more now faintly back to the deep recesses of
the mountain now distinctbut still faintas the hound comes over
some prominent point and the wind favors anon entirely lost in the
gully then breaking out again much nearerand growing more and more
pronounced as the dog approachestillwhen he comes around the brow of
the mountaindirectly above youthe barking is loud and sharpOn he
goes along the northern spurhis voice rising and sinking as the wind
and the lay of the ground modify ittill lost to hearing 

The fox usually keeps half a mile aheadregulating his speed by that of
the houndoccasionally pausing a moment to divert himself with a mouse 
or to contemplate the landscapeor to listen for his pursuerIf the
hound press him too closelyhe leads off from mountain to mountainand
so generally escapes the hunterbut if the pursuit be slowhe plays
about some ridge or peakand falls a preythough not an easy oneto
the experienced sportsman 

A most spirited and exciting chase occurs when the farm dog gets close
upon one in the open fieldas sometimes happens in the early morning 
The fox relies so confidently upon his superior speedthat I imagine
he half tempts the dog to the raceBut if the dog be a smart oneand
their course lies down hillover smooth groundReynard must put his
best foot forwardand then sometimes suffer the ignominy of being run
over by his pursuerwhohoweveris quite unable to pick him upowing
to the speedBut when they mount the hillor enter the woodsthe
superior nimbleness and agility of the fox tell at onceand he easily
leaves the dog far in his rearFor a cur less than his own size he
manifests little fearespecially if the two meet aloneremote from the
houseIn such casesI have seen first one turn tailthen the other 

One of the most notable features of the fox is his large and massive
tailSeen running on the snow at a distancehis tail is quite as
conspicuous as his bodyandso far from appearing a burdenseems to
contribute to his lightness and buoyancyIt softens the outline of his
movementsand repeats or continues to the eye the ease and poise of his
carriageButpursued by the hound on a wetthawy dayit often
becomes so heavy and bedraggled as to prove a serious inconvenienceand
compels him to take refuge in his denHe is very loath to do thisboth
his pride and the traditions of his race stimulate him to run it out 
and win by fair superiority of wind and speedand only a wound or a
heavy and moppish tail will drive him to avoid the issue in this manner 

To learn his surpassing shrewdness and cunningattempt to take him with
a trapRogue that he ishe always suspects some trickand one must be
more of a fox than he is himself to overreach himAt first sight it
would appear easy enoughWith apparent indifference he crosses your
pathor walks in your footsteps in the fieldor travels along the
beaten highwayor lingers in the vicinity of stacks and remote barns 
Carry the carcass of a pigor a fowlor a dogto a distant field in
midwinterand in a few nights his tracks cover the snow about it 

The inexperienced country youthmisled by this seeming carelessness of
Reynardsuddenly conceives a project to enrich himself with furand
wonders that the idea has not occurred to him beforeand to othersI
knew a youthful yeoman of this kindwho imagined he had found a mine of
wealth on discovering on a remote side hillbetween two woodsa dead
porkerupon which it appeared all the foxes of the neighborhood did
nightly banquetThe clouds were burdened with snowand as the first
flakes commenced to eddy downhe set outtrap and broom in hand 
already counting over in imagination the silver quarters he would
receive for his first fox skinWith the utmost careand with a
palpitating hearthe removed enough of the trodden snow to allow the
trap to sink below the surfaceThencarefully sifting the light
element over it and sweeping his tracks fullhe quickly withdrew 
laughing exultingly over the little surprise he had prepared for the
cunning rogueThe elements conspired to aid himand the falling snow
rapidly obliterated all vestiges of his workThe next morning at dawn
he was on his way to bring in his furThe snow had done its work
effectuallyandhe believedhad kept his secret wellArrived in
sight of the localityhe strained his vision to make out his prize
lodged against the fence at the foot of the hillApproaching nearer 
the surface was unbrokenand doubt usurped the place of certainty in
his mindA slight mound marked the site of the porkerbut there was no
footprint near itLooking up the hillhe saw where Reynard had walked
leisurely down toward his wonted bacon till within a few yards of it 
when he had wheeledand with prodigious strides disappeared in the
woodsThe young trapper saw at a glance what a comment this was upon
his skill in the artandindignantly exhuming the ironhe walked home
with itthe stream of silver quarters suddenly setting in another
direction 

The successful trapper commences in the fallor before the first deep
snowIn a field not too remotewith an old axe he cuts a small place 
say ten inches by fourteenin the frozen groundand removes the earth
to the depth of three or four inchesthen fills the cavity with dry
ashesin which are placed bits of roasted cheeseReynard is very
suspicious at firstand gives the place a wide berthIt looks like
designand he will see how the thing behaves before he approaches too
nearBut the cheese is savory and the cold severeHe ventures a little
closer every nightuntil he can reach and pick a piece from the
surfaceEmboldened by successlike other mortalshe presently digs
freely among the ashesandfinding a fresh supply of the delectable
morsels every nightis soon thrown off his guard and his suspicions
quite lulledAfter a week of baiting in this mannerand on the eve of
a light fall of snowthe trapper carefully conceals his trap in the
bedfirst smoking it thoroughly with hemlock boughs to kill or
neutralize all smell of the ironIf the weather favors and the proper
precautions have been takenhe may succeedthough the chances are
still greatly against him 

Reynard is usually caught very lightlyseldom more than the ends of his
toes being between the jawsHe sometimes works so cautiously as to
spring the trap without injury even to his toesor may remove the
cheese night after night without even springing itI knew an old
trapper whoon finding himself outwitted in this mannertied a bit of
cheese to the panand next morning had poor Reynard by the jawThe
trap is not fastenedbut only incumbered with a clogand is all the
more sure in its hold by yielding to every effort of the animal to
extricate himself 

When Reynard sees his captor approachinghe would fain drop into a
mouse hole to render himself invisibleHe crouches to the ground and
remains perfectly motionless until he perceives himself discoveredwhen
he makes one desperate and final effort to escapebut ceases all
struggling as you come upand behaves in a manner that stamps him a
very timid warrior cowering to the earth with a mingled look of shame 
guiltand humiliationA young farmer told me of tracing one with his
trap to the border of a woodwhere he discovered the cunning rogue
trying to hide by embracing a small treeMost animalswhen taken in a
trapshow fightbut Reynard has more faith in the nimbleness of his
feet than in the terror of his teeth 

I once spent a summer month in a mountainous district in the State of
New Yorkwherefrom its earliest settlementthe red fox has been the
standing prize for skill in the use of the trap and gunAt the house
where I was stopping were two foxhoundsand a neighbor half a mile
distant had a thirdThere were many others in the townshipand in
season they were well employedtoobut the three spoken ofattended
by their ownersheld high carnival on the mountains in the immediate
vicinityAnd many were the foxes thatwinter after winterfell before
themtwenty five having been shotthe season before my visiton one
small range aloneAnd yet the foxes were apparently never more abundant
than they were that summerand never boldercoming at night within a
few rods of the house and of the unchained alert houndsand making
havoc among the poultry 

One morning a largefat goose was found minus her head and otherwise
mangledBoth hounds had disappearedandas they did not come back
till near nightit was inferred that they had cut short Reynard s
repastand given him a good chase into the bargainBut next night he
was back againand this time got safely off with the gooseA couple of
nights after he must have come with recruitsfor next morning three
large goslings were reported missingThe silly geese now got it
through their noddles that there was danger aboutand every night
thereafter came close up to the house to roost 

A brood of turkeysthe old one tied to a tree a few rods to the rear of
the housewere the next objects of attackThe predaceous rascal came 
as usualin the latter half of the nightI happened to be awakeand
heard the helpless turkey cryQuitquit with great emphasisAnother
sleeperon the floor above mewhoit seemshad been sleeping with
one ear awake for several nights in apprehension for the safety of his
turkeysheard the sound alsoand instantly divined its causeI heard
the window open and a voice summon the dogsA loud bellow was the
responsewhich caused Reynard to take himself off in a hurryA moment
moreand the mother turkey would have shared the fate of the geese 
There she lay at the end of her tetherwith extended wingsbitten and
rumpledThe young ones roosted in a row on the fence near byand had
taken flight on the first alarm 

Turkeysretaining many of their wild instinctsare less easily
captured by the fox than any other of our domestic fowlsOn the
slightest show of danger they take to wingand it is not unusualin
the locality of which I speakto find them in the morning perched in
the most unwonted placesas on the peak of the barn or hay shedor on
the tops of the apple treestheir tails spread and their manners
showing much excitementPerchance one turkey is minus her tailthe fox
having succeeded in getting only a mouthful of quills 

As the brood grows and their wings developthey wander far from the
house in quest of grasshoppersAt such times they are all watchfulness
and suspicionCrossing the fields one dayattended by a dog that much
resembled a foxI came suddenly upon a brood about one third grown 
which were feeding in a pasture just beyond a woodIt so happened that
they caught sight of the dog without seeing mewhen instantlywith the
celerity of wild gamethey launched into the airandwhile the old
one perched upon a treetopas if to keep an eye on the supposed enemy 
the young went sailing over the trees toward home 

The two hounds before referred toaccompanied by a cur dogwhose
business it was to mind the farmbut who took as much delight in
running away from prosy duty as if he had been a schoolboywould
frequently steal off and have a good hunt all by themselvesjust for
the fun of the thingI supposeI more than half suspect that it was as
a kind of taunt or retaliation that Reynard came and took the geese
from under their very nosesOne morning they went off and stayed till
the afternoon of the next daythey ran the fox all day and all night 
the hounds baying at every jumpthe cur dog silent and tenaciousWhen
the trio returned they came dragging themselves alongstifffoot sore 
gauntand hungryFor a day or two afterward they lay about the
kennelsseeming to dread nothing so much as the having to moveThe
stolen hunt was theirspree and of course they must take time to get
over it 

Some old hunters think the fox enjoys the chase as much as the hound 
especially when the latter runs slowlyas the best hounds doThe fox
will wait for the houndwill sit down and listenor play about 
crossing and recrossing and doubling upon his trackas if enjoying a
mischievous consciousness of the perplexity he would presently cause his
pursuerIt is evidenthoweverthat the fox does not always have his
share of the funbefore a swift dogor in a deep snowor on a wet day
when his tail gets heavyhe must put his best foot forwardAs a last
resort heholes up Sometimes he resorts to numerous devices to
mislead and escape the dog altogetherHe will walk in the bed of a
small creekor on a rail fenceI heard of an instance of a foxhard
and long pressedthat took to a rail fenceandafter walking some
distancemade a leap to one side to a hollow stumpin the cavity of
which he snugly stowed himselfThe ruse succeededand the dogs lost
the trailbut the huntercoming uppassed by chance near the stump 
when out bounded the foxhis cunning availing him less than he
deservedOn another occasion the fox took to the public roadand
stepped with great care and precision into a sleigh trackThe hard 
polished snow took no imprint of the light footand the scent was no
doubt less than it would have been on a rougher surfaceMaybealso 
the rogue had considered the chances of another sleigh coming along 
before the houndand obliterating the trail entirely 

Audubon tells of a foxwhichwhen started by the houndsalways
managed to elude them at a certain pointFinally the hunter concealed
himself in the localityto discoverif possiblethe trickPresently
along came the foxandmaking a leap to one sideran up the trunk of
a fallen tree which had lodged some feet from the groundand concealed
himself in the topIn a few minutes the hounds came upand in their
eagerness passed some distance beyond the pointand then went still
fartherlooking for the lost trailThen the fox hastened downand 
taking his back trackfooled the dogs completely 

I was told of a silver gray fox in northern New Yorkwhichwhen
pursued by the houndswould run till it had hunted up another foxor
the fresh trail of onewhen it would so manoeuvre that the hound would
invariably be switched off on the second track 

In colddry weather the fox will sometimes elude the houndat least
delay him muchby taking to a bareploughed fieldThe harddry earth
seems not to retain a particle of the scentand the hound gives a loud 
longpeculiar barkto signify he has troubleIt is now his turn to
show his witwhich he often does by passing completely around the
fieldand resuming the trail again where it crosses the fence or a
strip of snow 

The fact that any dryhard surface is unfavorable to the hound
suggestsin a measurethe explanation of the wonderful faculty that
all dogs in a degree possess of tracking an animal by the scent of the
foot aloneDid you ever think why a dog s nose is always wet Examine
the nose of a fox houndfor instancehow very moist and sensitive!
Cause this moisture to dry upand the dog would be as powerless to
track an animal as you are! The nose of the catyou may observeis
but a little moistandas you knowher sense of smell is far inferior
to that of the dogMoisten your own nostrils and lipsand this sense
is plainly sharpenedThe sweat of a dog s nosethereforeis no doubt
a vital element in its powerandwithout taking a very long logical
stridewe may infer how a damprough surface aids him in tracking
game 

A still hunt rarely brings you in sight of a foxas his ears are much
sharper than yoursand his tread much lighterBut if the fox is
mousing in the fieldsand you discover him before he does youyou may 
the wind favoringcall him within a few paces of youSecrete yourself
behind the fenceor some other objectand squeak as nearly like a
mouse as possibleReynard will hear the sound at an incredible
distancePricking up his earshe gets the directionand comes
trotting along as unsuspiciously as can beI have never had an
opportunity to try the experimentbut I know perfectly reliable persons
who haveOne manin the pasture getting his cowscalled a fox which
was too busy mousing to get the first sighttill it jumped upon the
wall just over where he sat secretedHe then sprang upgiving a loud
whoop at the same timeand the foxI suspectcame as near being
frightened out of his skin as a fox ever was 

I have never been able to see clearly why the mother fox generally
selects a burrow or hole in the open field in which to have her young 
except it beas some hunters maintainfor better securityThe young
foxes are wont to come out on a warm dayand play like puppies in front
of the denThe view being unobstructed on all sides by trees or bushes 
in the cover of which danger might approachthey are less liable to
surprise and captureOn the slightest sound they disappear in the hole 
Those who have watched the gambols of the young foxes speak of them as
very amusingeven more arch and playful than those of kittenswhile a
spirit profoundly wise and cunning seems to look out of their young
eyesThe parent fox can never be caught in the den with thembut is
hovering near the woodswhich are always at handand by her warning
cry or bark telling them when to be on their guardShe usually has at
least three densat no great distance apartand moves stealthily in
the night with her charge from one to the otherso as to mislead her
enemiesMany a party of boysand of mentoodiscovering the
whereabouts of a litterhave gone with shovels and picksandafter
digging away vigorously for several hourshave found only an empty hole
for their painsThe old foxfinding her secret had been found out 
had waited for darknessin the cover of which to transfer her household
to new quartersor else some old fox hunterjealous of the
preservation of his gameand getting word of the intended destruction
of the litterhad gone at dusk the night beforeand made some
disturbance about the denperhaps flashed some powder in its mouth a
hint which the shrewd animal knew how to interpret 

The fox nearly always takes his nap during the day in the open fields 
along the sides of the ridgesor under the mountainwhere he can look
down upon the busy farms beneath and hear their many soundsthe barking
of dogsthe lowing of cattlethe cackling of hensthe voices of men
and boysor the sound of travel upon the highwayIt is on that side 
toothat he keeps the sharpest lookoutand the appearance of the
hunter above and behind him is always a surprise 

Foxesunlike wolvesnever go in packs or companiesbut hunt singly 
Many of the ways and manners of the foxwhen tamedare like the dog s 
I once saw a young red fox exposed for sale in the market in Washington 
A colored man had himand said he had caught him out in VirginiaHe
led him by a small chainas he would a puppyand the innocent young
rascal would lie on his side and bask and sleep in the sunshineamid
all the noise and chaffering around himprecisely like a dogHe was
about the size of a full grown catand there was a bewitching beauty
about him that I could hardly resistOn another occasionI saw a gray
foxabout two thirds grownplaying with a dogabout the same size 
and by nothing in the manners of either could you tell which was the dog
and which was the fox

THE WEASEL


My most interesting note of the season ofrelates to a weaselOne
day in early Novembermy boy and I were sitting on a rock at the edge
of a tamarack swamp in the woodshoping to get a glimpse of some grouse
which we knew were in the habit of feeding in the swampWe had not sat
there very long before we heard a slight rustling in the leaves below
uswhich we at once fancied was made by the cautious tread of a grouse 
(We had no gun ) Presentlythrough the thick brushy growthwe caught
sight of a small animal running alongthat we at first took for a red
squirrelA moment moreand it came into full view but a few yards from
usand we saw that it was a weaselA second glance showed that it
carried something in its mouth whichas it drew nearwe saw was a
mouse or a mole of some sortThe weasel ran nimbly alongnow the
length of a decayed logthen over stones and branchespausing a moment
every three or four yardsand passed within twenty feet of usand
disappeared behind some rocks on the bank at the edge of the swamp He
is carrying food into his den I said let us watch him In four or
five minutes he reappearedcoming back over the course along which he
had just passedrunning over and under the same stones and down the
same decayed logand was soon out of sight in the swampWe had not
movedand evidently he had not noticed usAfter about six minutes we
heard the same rustle as at firstand in a moment saw the weasel coming
back with another mouse in his mouthHe kept to his former route as if
chained to itmaking the same pauses and gesturesand repeating
exactly his former movementsHe disappeared on our left as beforeand 
after a few momentsdelayreemerged and took his course down into the
swamp againWe waited about the same length of time as beforewhen
back he came with another mouseHe evidently had a big crop of mice
down there amid the bogs and bushesand he was gathering his harvest in
very industriouslyWe became curious to see exactly where his den was 
and so walked around where he had seemed to disappear each timeand
waitedHe was as punctual as usualand was back with his game exactly
on timeIt happened that we had stopped within two paces of his hole 
so thatas he approached ithe evidently discovered usHe paused 
looked steadily at usand thenwithout any sign of fearentered his
denThe entrance was not under the rocks as we had expected to find it 
but was in the bank a few feet beyond themWe remained motionless for
some timebut he did not reappearOur presence had made him
suspiciousand he was going to wait a whileThen I removed some dry
leaves and exposed his doorwaya smallround holehardly as large as
the chipmunk makesgoing straight down into the groundWe had a lively
curiosity to get a peep into his larderIf he had been carrying in mice
at this rate very longhis cellars must be packed with themWith a
sharp stick I began digging into the red clayey soilbut soon
encountered so many roots from near trees that I gave it updeciding to
return next day with a mattockSo I repaired the damages I had done as
well as I couldreplacing the leavesand we moved off 

The next daywhich was mild and stillI came back preparedas I
thoughtto unearth the weasel and his treasuresI sat down where we
had sat the day before and awaited developmentsI was curious to know
if the weasel was still carrying in his harvestI had sat but a few
minutes when I heard again the rustle in the dry leavesand saw the
weasel coming home with another mouseI observed him till he had made
three tripsabout every six or seven minutesI calculatedhe brought
in a mouseThen I went and stood near his holeThis time he had a fat
meadow mouseHe laid it down near the entrancewent in and turned
aroundand reached out and drew the mouse in after himThat store of
mice I am bound to seeI thoughtand then fell to with the heavy
mattockI followed the hole down about two feetwhen it turned to the
northI kept the clue by thrusting into the passage slender twigs 
these it was easy to followTwo or three feet more and the hole
branchedone part going westthe other northeastI followed the west
one a few feet till it branchedThen I turned to the easterly tunnel 
and pursued it till it branchedI followed one of these ways till it
dividedI began to be embarrassed and hindered by the accumulations of
loose soilEvidently this weasel had foreseen just such an assault upon
his castle as I was makingand had planned it accordinglyHe was not
to be caught nappingI found several enlargements in the various
tunnelsbreathing spacesor spaces to turn around inor to meet and
chat with a companionbut nothing that looked like a terminusa
permanent living roomI tried removing the soil a couple of paces away
with the mattockbut found it slow workI was getting warm and tired 
and my task was apparently only just begunThe farther I dugthe more
numerous and intricate became the passagesI concluded to stopand
come again the next dayarmed with a shovel in addition to the mattock 

AccordinglyI came back on the morrowand fell to work vigorouslyI
soon had quite a large excavationI found the bank a labyrinth of
passageswith here and there a large chamberOne of the latter I
struck only six inches under the surfaceby making a fresh breach a few
feet away 

While I was leaning upon my shovel handle and recovering my breathI
heard some light footed creature tripping over the leaves above me just
out of viewwhich I fancied might be a squirrelPresently I heard the
bay of a hound and the yelp of a curand then knew that a rabbit had
passed near meThe dogs came hurrying afterwith a great rumpusand
then presently the hunters followedThe dogs remained barking not many
rods south of me on the edge of the swampand I knew the rabbit had run
to holeFor half an hour or more I heard the hunters at work there 
digging their game outthen they came along and discovered me at my
workThey proved to be an old trapper and woodsman and his sonI told
them what I was in quest of A mountain weasel said the old man 
 Seven or eight years ago I used to set deadfalls for rabbits just over
thereand the game was always partly eaten upIt must have been this
weasel that visited my traps So my game was evidently an old resident
of the placeThis swampmaybehad been his hunting ground for many
yearsand he had added another hall to his dwelling each yearAfter
further diggingI struck at least one of his banqueting hallsa cavity
about the size of one s hatarched over by a network of fine
tree rootsThe occupant evidently lodged or rested here alsoThere was
a warmdry nestmade of leaves and the fur of mice and molesI took
out two or three handfulsIn finding this chamber I had followed one of
the tunnels around till it brought me within a foot of the original
entranceA few inches to one side of this cavity there was what I took
to be a back alley where the weasel threw his wastethere were large
masses of wetdecaying fur hereand fur pellets such as are
regurgitated by hawks and owlsIn the nest there was the tail of a
flying squirrelshowing that the weasel sometimes had this game for
supper or dinner 

I continued my digging with renewed energyI should yet find the grand
depot where all these passages centredbut the farther I excavatedthe
more complex and baffling the problem becamethe ground was honeycombed
with passagesWhat enemy has this weaselI said to myselfthat he
should provide so many ways of escapethat he should have a back door
at every turn To corner him would be impossibleto be lost in his
fortress was like being lost in Mammoth CaveHow he could bewilder his
pursuer by appearing now at this doornow at thatnow mocking him from
the atticnow defying him from the cellar! So farI had discovered but
one entrancebut some of the chambers were so near the surface that it
looked as if the planner had calculated upon an emergency when he might
want to reach daylight quickly in a new place 

Finally I pausedrested upon my shovel a whileeased my aching back
upon the groundand then gave it upfeeling as I never had before the
force of the old sayingthat you cannot catch a weasel asleepI had
made an ugly hole in the bankhad handled over two or three times a ton
or more of earthand was apparently no nearer the weasel and his store
of mice than when I began 

Then I regretted that I had broken into his castle at allthat I had
not contented myself with coming day after day and counting his mice as
he carried them inand continued my observation upon him each
succeeding yearNow the rent in his fortress could not be repairedand
he would doubtless move awayas he most certainly didfor his doors 
which I had closed with soilremained unopened after winter had set in 

But little seems known about the intimate private lives of any of our
lesser wild creaturesIt was news to me that any of the weasels lived
in dens in this wayand that they stored up provision against a day of
needThis species was probably the little ermineeight or nine inches
longwith tail about five inchesIt was still in its summer dress of
dark chestnut brown above and whitish below 

It was a mystery where the creature had put the earth which it must have
removed in digging its dennot a grain was to be seen anywhereand yet
a bushel or more must have been taken outExternallythere was not the
slightest sign of that curious habitation there under the groundThe
entrance was hidden beneath dry leavesand was surrounded by little
passages and flourishes between the leaves and the groundIf any of my
readers find a weasel s denI hope they will be wiser than I wasand
observe his goings and comings without disturbing his habitation 

A few years later I had another adventure with a weasel that had its den
in a bank on the margin of a muck swamp in the same neighborhoodWe had
cleared and drained and redeemed the swamp and made it into a garden 
and I had built me a lodge thereThe weasel s hunting groundswhere
doubtless he had been wont to gather his supply of micehad been
destroyedand he hadgot evenwith me by preying upon my young
chickensNight after night the number of chickens grew lesstill one
day we chanced to see the creature boldly chasing one of the larger
fowls along the road near the henhouseHis career was cut short then
and there by one of the menWe were then ignorant of the den in the
bank a few yards awayThe next season my chickens were preyed upon
againthey were killed upon the roostand their half eaten bodies were
found under the floorOne night I was awakened about midnight by that
louddesperate cry which a barn fowl gives when suddenly seized upon
its roostWas I dreamingor was that a cry of murder from my
chickens I seized my lanternand with my dog rushed out to where a
pair of nearly grown roosters passed the nights upon a low stumpThey
were both goneand the action of the dog betrayed the fresh scent of
some animalBut we could get no clue to the chickens or their enemyI
felt sure that only one of the fowls had been seizedand that the other
had dashed away wildly in the darknesswhich proved to be the caseThe
dead chicken was there under the edge of the stumpwhere I found it in
the morningand its companion came forth unhurt during the day 
Thenceforth the chickensbig and littlewere all shut up in the
henhouse at nightOn the third day the appetite of the weasel was keen
againand it boldly gave chase to a chicken before our eyesI was
standing in my porch with my dogtalking with my neighbor and his wife 
whowith their dogwere standing in the road a few yards in front of
meA chicken suddenly screamed in the bushes up behind the rocks just
beyond my friendsThen it came rushing down over the rocks past them 
flying and screamingclosely pursued by a longslim red animalthat
seemed to slide over the rocks like a serpentIts legs were so short
that one saw only the swiftgliding motion of its bodyAcross the road
into the gardenwithin a yard of my friendswent the pursued and the
pursuerand into the garden rushed I and my dogThe weasel seized the
chicken by the wingand was being dragged along by the latter in its
effort to escapewhen I arrived upon the sceneWith a savage glee I
had not felt for many a dayI planted my foot upon the weaselThe soft
muck underneath yieldedand I held him without hurting himHe let go
his hold upon the chicken and seized the sole of my shoe in his teeth 
Then I reached down and gripped him with my thumb and forefinger just
back of the earsand lifted him upand looked his impotent rage in the
faceWhat gleaming eyeswhat an array of threatening teethwhat
reaching of vicious clawswhat a wriggling and convulsed body! But I
held him firmlyHe could only scratch my hand and dart fire from his
electricbead like eyesIn the mean time my dog was bounding up 
begging to be allowed to have his way with the weaselBut I knew what
he did notI knew that in anything like a fair encounter the weasel
would get the first holdwould draw the first bloodand hence probably
effect his escapeSo I carried the animalwrithing and scratchingto
a place in the road removed from any near coverand threw him violently
upon the groundhoping thereby so to stun and bewilder him that the
terrier could rush in and crush him before he recovered his witsBut I
had miscalculatedthe blow did indeed stun and confuse himbut he was
still too quick for the dogand had him by the lip like an electric
trapNip lifted up his head and swung the weasel violently about in the
airtrying to shake him offuttering a cry of rage and painbut did
not succeed in loosening the animal s hold for some momentsWhen he had
done soand attempted to seize him a second timethe weasel was first
againbut quickly released his hold and darted about this way and that 
seeking coverThree or four times the dog was upon himbut found him
each time too hot to be heldSeeing that the creature was likely to
escapeI set my foot upon him againand made a finish of him 

The weasel is the boldest and most bloodthirsty of our small mammals 
indeednone of our larger beasts are more soThere is something
devilish and uncanny about itIt persists like fateit eludesbut
cannot be eludedThe terror it inspires in the smaller creaturesrats 
rabbitschipmunksis pitiful to beholdA rat pursued by a weasel has
been known to rush into a roomuttering dismal criesand seek the
protection of a man in bedA chipmunk will climb to the top of a tall
tree to elude itand thenwhen followedlet go its hold and drop
with a cry of despair toward the groundA friend of minewalking along
the road early one morningsaw a rat rush over the fence and cross a
few yards ahead of himPressing it close came a weaselwhich seized
the rat before it could gain the opposite wallMy friend rushed to the
aid of the rat with his caneBut the weasel dodged his blowsand in a
moment or two turned fiercely upon himMy friend aimed more blows at it
without effectwhen the weasel began leaping up before himwithin a
few feet of his faceits eyes gleamingits teeth threateningand
dodging every blow aimed at itThe effectmy friend sayswas
singularly uncanny and startlingIt was like some infuriated imp of
Satan dancing before himand watching for a chance to seize him by the
throat or to dash into his eyesHe slowly backed offbeating the air
with his caneThen the weasel returned to the disabled rat and
attempted to drag it into the wallMy friend now began to hurl stones
at itbut it easily dodged themNow he was joined by another
passer byand the two opened upon the weasel with stonestill finally 
in dodging oneit was caught by the otherand so much hurt that it
gave up the rat and sought shelter in the wallwhere it was left
waiting to secure its game when its enemies should have gone on 

I must give one more instance of the boldness and ferocity of the
weaselA woman in northern Vermont discovered that something was
killing her hensoften on the nestShe watched for the culpritand at
last caught a weasel in the actIt had seized the henand refused to
let go when she tried to scare it awayThen the woman laid hold of it
and tried choking itwhen the weasel released its hold upon the hen and
fastened its teeth into her hand between the thumb and forefingerShe
could not choke it offand ran to a neighbor for helpbut no one could
remove it without tearing the flesh from the woman s handThen some one
suggested a pail of waterinto this the hand and weasel were plunged 
but the creature would not let go even thenand did not until it was
drowned 

The weasel is a subtle and destructive enemy of the birdsIt climbs
trees and explores them with great ease and nimblenessI have seen it
do so on several occasionsOne day my attention was arrested by the
angry notes of a pair of brown thrashers that were flitting from bush to
bush along an old stone wall in a remote fieldPresently I saw what it
was that excited them three large red weaselsor erminescoming
along the stone walland leisurely and half playfully exploring every
tree that stood near itThey had probably robbed the thrashersThey
would go up the trees with great easeand glide serpent like out upon
the main branchesWhen they descended the treethey were unable to
come straight downlike a squirrelbut went around it spirallyHow
boldly they thrust their heads out of the walland eyed me and sniffed
me as I drew near their roundthin earstheir prominentglistening 
bead like eyesand the curvingsnake like motions of the head and neck
being very noticeableThey looked like blood suckers and egg suckers 
They suggested something extremely remorseless and cruelOne could
understand the alarm of the rats when they discover one of these
fearlesssubtleand circumventing creatures threading their holesTo
flee must be like trying to escape death itselfI was one day standing
in the woods upon a flat stonein what at certain seasons was the bed
of a streamwhen one of these weasels came undulating along and ran
under the stone upon which I was standingAs I remained motionlesshe
thrust out his wedge shaped headand turned it back above the stone as
if half in mind to seize my footthen he drew backand presently went
his wayThese weasels often hunt in packs like the British stoatWhen
I was a boymy father one day armed me with an old musket and sent me
to shoot chipmunks around the cornWhile watching the squirrelsa
troop of weasels tried to cross a bar way where I satand were so bent
on doing it that I fired at themboy likesimply to thwart their
purposeOne of the weasels was disabled by my shotbut the troop was
not discouragedandafter making several feints to crossone of them
seized the wounded one and bore it overand the pack disappeared in the
wall on the other side 

Let me conclude this chapter with two or three more notes about this
alert enemy of the birds and lesser animalsthe weasel 

A farmer one day heard a queer growling sound in the grasson
approaching the spot he saw two weasels contending over a mouseboth
held the mousepulling in opposite directionsand they were so
absorbed in the struggle that the farmer cautiously put his hands down
and grabbed them both by the back of the neckHe put them in a cage 
and offered them bread and other foodThis they refused to eatbut in
a few days one of them had eaten the other uppicking his bones clean 
and leaving nothing but the skeleton 

The same farmer was one day in his cellar when two rats came out of a
hole near him in great hasteand ran up the cellar wall and along its
top till they came to a floor timber that stopped their progresswhen
they turned at bayand looked excitedly back along the course they had
comeIn a moment a weaselevidently in hot pursuit of themcame out
of the holebutseeing the farmerchecked his course and darted back 
The rats had doubtless turned to give him fightand would probably have
been a match for him 

The weasel seems to track its game by scentA hunter of my acquaintance
was one day sitting in the woodswhen he saw a red squirrel run with
great speed up a tree near himand out upon a long branchfrom which
he leaped to some rocksdisappearing beneath themIn a moment a weasel
came in full course upon his trailran up the treethen out along the
branchleaping from there to the rocks just as the squirrel had done
and pursuing him into their recesses 

Doubtless the squirrel fell a prey to himThe squirrel s best game
would have been to keep to the higher treetopswhere he could easily
have distanced the weaselBut beneath the rocks he stood a very poor
chanceI have often wondered what keeps such an animal as the weasel in
checkfor they are quite rareThey never need go hungryfor rats and
squirrels and mice and birds are everywhereThey probably do not fall
a prey to any other animaland they are very rarely captured or killed
by manBut the circumstances or agencies that check the increase of any
species of animal areas Darwin saysvery obscure and but little
known

THE MINK


In walking through the woods one day in early winterwe read upon the
newly fallen snow the record of a mink s fright the night beforeThe
mink had been traveling through the woods post hastenot along the
watercourses where one sees them by daybut over ridges and across
valleysWe followed his track some distance to see what adventures he
had met withWe tracked him through a bushy swampand saw where he had
left it to explore a pile of rocksthen where he had taken to the swamp
againand where he had entered the more open woodsPresently the track
turned sharply aboutand doubled upon itself in long hurried strides 
What had caused the mink to change his mind so suddenly We explored a
few paces aheadand came upon a fox trackThe mink had probably seen
the fox stalking stealthily through the woodsand the sight had
doubtless brought his heart into his mouthI think he climbed a tree 
and waited till the fox had passedHis track disappeared amid a clump
of hemlocksand then reappeared again a little beyond themIt
described a big loop aroundand then crossed the fox track only a few
yards from the point where its course was interruptedThen it followed
a little watercoursewent under a rude bridge in a wood roadthen
mingled with squirrel tracks in a denser part of the thicketIf the
mink met a muskrat or a rabbit in his travelsor came upon a grouseor
quailor a farmer s henroosthe had the supper he was in quest of 

I followed a mink s track one morning upon the snow till I found where
the prowler had overtaken and killed a muskrat by a stone wall near a
little streamThe blood upon the snow and the half devoured body of the
rat told the whole storyThe mink is very fond of muskratsand
trappers often use this flesh to bait their trapsI wonder if he has
learned to enter the under water hole to the muskrat s denand then
seek him in his chamber abovewhere the poor rat would have little
chance to escape 

The mink is only a larger weaseland has much of the boldness and
bloodthirstiness of that animalOne summer day my dog Lark and I were
sitting beside a small watercourse in the woodswhen I saw a mink
coming up the stream toward usI sat motionless till the mink was
within a few feet of uswhen the dog saw himAs the dog sprangthe
mink darted under a large flat stoneLark was very fierceand seemed
to say to me Just lift up that stone and I will show you my way with
minks This I quickly didand the dog sprang for the gamebut he as
quickly withdrew with a cry of pain as if he had touched something
red hotThe mink had got in the first blow or biteand then effected
his escape between my feet and the dog sas if he had vanished in the
airWhere he went to was a mysteryThere was no holeno depth of
waterno hiding place anywhere that I could discover or that the dog
could discoverand yet the mink had disappearedIt was like some
conjurer s trick 

Minks are fond of fishand can capture them in the waterThis makes
them very destructive along small trout streams and pondsI once saw a
trout with an ugly gash in its sidewhich was doubtless the work of a
minkWith a friendI once had a camp by a trout stream in the
Catskills that we namedMink Camp by reason of the number of minks
that came every night as soon as it was darkto devour the fish heads
and entrails that we threw over on the opposite bankWe could often
hear them disputing over the spoilsand in the dim light of the
camp fire could sometimes see them 

You may know the mink s track upon the snow from those of the squirrels
at onceIn the squirrel track the prints of the large hind feet are
aheadwith the prints of the smaller fore feet just behind themas in
the case of the rabbitThe minkin runningusually plants his hind
feet exactly upon the track of his fore feetand closer together than
the squirrelso that his trail upon the snow is something like this 

One winter day I had a good view of a mink running upon the snow and ice
along the edge of a streamHe had seen or heard meand was making a
little extra speedHe bounded along with his back much archedin a
curiously stiff and mechanical sort of waywith none of the grace and
ease of the squirrelHe leaped highand cleared about two and a half
feet at a bound 

THE RACCOON

In March that brief summary of a bearthe raccooncomes out of his den
in the ledgesand leaves his sharp digitigrade track upon the
snow traveling not unfrequently in pairs a leanhungry couplebent
on pillage and plunderThey have an unenviable time of it feasting in
the summer and fallhibernating in winterand starving in springIn
April I have found the young of the previous year creeping about the
fieldsso reduced by starvation as to be quite helplessand offering
no resistance to my taking them up by the tail and carrying them home 

The old ones also become very much emaciatedand come boldly up to the
barn or other out buildings in quest of foodI rememberone morning in
early springhearing old Cuffthe farm dogbarking vociferously
before it was yet lightWhen we got up we discovered him at the foot of
an ash treewhich stood about thirty rods from the houselooking up at
some gray object in the leafless branchesand by his manners and his
voice evincing great impatience that we were so tardy in coming to his
assistanceArrived on the spotwe saw in the tree a coon of unusual
sizeOne bold climber proposed to go up and shake it downThis was
what old Cuff wantedand he fairly bounded with delight as he saw his
young master shinning up the treeApproaching within eight or ten feet
of the coonthe climber seized the branch to which it clung and shook
long and fiercelyBut the coon was in no danger of losing its holdand
when the climber paused to renew his hold it turned toward him with a
growland showed very clearly a purpose to advance to the attackThis
caused its pursuer to descend to the ground again with all speedWhen
the coon was finally brought down with a gunit fought the dogwhich
was a largepowerful animalwith great furyreturning bite for bite
for some momentsand after a quarter of an hour had elapsedand its
unequal antagonist had shaken it as a terrier does a ratmaking his
teeth meet through the small of its backthe coon still showed fight 

The coon is very tenacious of lifeand like the badger will always whip
a dog of its own size and weightA woodchuck can bite severelyhaving
teeth that cut like chiselsbut a coon has agility and power of limb as
well 

Coons are considered game only in the fallor towards the close of
summerwhen they become fat and their flesh sweetAt this time 
cooning is a famous pastime in the remote interiorAs these animals are
entirely nocturnal in their habitsthey are hunted only at nightA
piece of corn on some remote side hill near the mountainor between two
pieces of woodsis most apt to be frequented by themWhile the corn is
yet green they pull the ears down like hogsandtearing open the
sheathing of huskseat the tendersucculent kernelsbruising and
destroying much more than they devourSometimes their ravages are a
matter of serious concern to the farmerBut every such neighborhood has
its coon dogand the boys and young men dearly love the sportThe
party sets out about eight or nine o clock of a darkmoonless night 
and stealthily approaches the cornfieldThe dog knows his businessand
when he is put into a patch of corn and told tohunt them uphe makes
a thorough searchand will not be misled by any other scentYou hear
him rattling through the cornhither and yonwith great speedThe
coons prick up their earsand quickly take themselves off on the
opposite side of the fieldIn the stillness you may sometimes hear a
single stone rattle on the wall as they hurry toward the woodsIf the
dog finds nothing he comes back to his master in a short timeand says
in his dumb way No coon there But if he strikes a trail you
presently hear a louder rattling on the stone walland then a hurried
bark as he enters the woodssucceeded in a few minutes by loud and
repeated barkings as he reaches the foot of the tree in which the coon
has taken refugeThen follows a pellmell rush as the cooning party dash
up the hillinto the woodsthrough the brush and the darknessfalling
over prostrate treespitching into gullies and hollowslosing hats and
tearing clothestill finallyguided by the baying of the faithful dog 
they reach the treeThe first thing now in order is to kindle a fire 
andif its light reveals the coonto shoot himif notto fell the
tree with an axeunless this last expedient happens to be too great a
sacrifice of timber and of strengthin which case it is necessary to
sit down at the foot of the tree and wait till morning 

THE PORCUPINE


Among our wild animals there are three that are slow moving 
dull wittedand almost fearless the skunkthe opossumand the
porcupineThe two latter seem to be increasing in most parts of the
countryThe opossum is becoming quite common in the valley of the
Hudsonand the porcupine is frequently met with in parts of the country
where it was rarely or never seen forty years ago 

When the boys in late fall now go cooning where I used to go cooning in
my youththe dogs often run on a porcupine or drive him up a treeand
thus the sport is interruptedSometimes the dog comes to them with his
mouth stuck full of quillsand is then compelled to submit to the
painful operation of having them withdrawn 

A sportsman relates that he once came upon a dead porcupine and a dead
bald eagle lying upon the ground within a few yards of each otherThe
eagle had partly torn the porcupine to piecesbut in attacking it with
its beak it had driven numerous spines of the animal into its throat 
and from their effect had apparently died as soon as its victim 

The quill of a porcupine is like a bad habitif it once gets hold it
constantly works deeper and deeperthough the quill has no power of
motion in itselfit is the liveactive flesh of its victim that draws
it in by means of the barbed pointOne day my boy and I encountered a
porcupine on the top of one of the Catskillsand we had a little circus
with himwe wanted to wake him upand make him show a little
excitementif possibleWithout violence or injury to himwe succeeded
to the extent of making his eyes fairly stand out from his headbut
quicken his motion he would not probably could not 

What astonished and alarmed him seemed to be that his quills had no
effect upon his enemiesthey laughed at his weaponsHe stuck his head
under a rock and left his back and tail exposedThis is the porcupine s
favorite position of defense Now come if you dare he seems to say 
Touch his tailand like a trap it springs up and strikes your hand full
of little quillsThe tail is the active weapon of defensewith this
the animal strikesIt is the outpost that delivers its fire before the
citadel is reachedIt is doubtless this fact that has given rise to the
popular notion that the porcupine can shoot its quillswhich of course
it cannot do 

With a rotten stick we sprang the animal s tail again and againtill
its supply of quills began to run lowand the creature grew uneasy 
 What does this meanhe seemed to sayhis excitement risingHis
shield upon his backtoowe trifled withand when we finally drew him
forth with a forked stickhis eyes were ready to burst from his head 
In what a peevishinjured tone the creature did complain of our unfair
tactics! He protested and protestedand whimpered and scoldedlike
some infirm old man tormented by boysHis game after we led him forth
was to keep himself as much as possible in the shape of a ballbut with
two sticks and a cord we finally threw him over on his back and exposed
his quill less and vulnerable under sidewhen he fairly surrendered and
seemed to say Now you may do with me as you like Then we laughed in
his face and went our way 

Before we had reached our camp I was suddenly seized with a strange 
acute pain in one of my feetIt seemed as if a large nerve was being
roughly sawed in twoI could not take another stepSitting down and
removing my shoe and stockingI searched for the cause of the
paralyzing painThe foot was free from mark or injurybut what was
that little thorn or fang of thistle doing on the ankle I pulled it out
and found it to be one of the lesser quills of the porcupineBy some
meansduring ourcircus the quill had dropped inside my stocking 
the thing hadtaken and the porcupine had his revenge for all the
indignities we had put upon himI was well punishedThe nerve which
the quill struck had unpleasant memories of it for many months
afterward 

When you come suddenly upon the porcupine in his native hauntshe draws
his head back and downputs up his shieldtrails his broad tailand
waddles slowly awayHis shield is the sheaf of larger quills upon his
backwhich he opens and spreads out in a circular form so that the
whole body is quite hidden beneath itThe porcupine s great chisel like
teethwhich are quite as formidable as those of the woodchuckhe does
not appear to use at all in his defensebut relies entirely upon his
quillsand when those fail him he is done for 

I once passed a summer night alone upon the highest peak of the
CatskillsSlide MountainI soon found there were numerous porcupines
that desired to keep me companyThe news of my arrival in the
afternoon seemed to have spread rapidly among themThey probably had
scented meAfter resting awhile I set out to look up the springand
met a porcupine on his way toward my campHe turned out in the grass 
and thenas I pausedcame back into the path and passed directly over
my feetHe evidently felt that he had as good a right to the road as I
hadhe had traveled it many times before meWhen I charged upon him
with a stick in my handhe slowly climbed a small balsam fir 

I soon found the place of the springandhaving dredged it and cleaned
itI sat down upon a rock and waited for the water slowly to seep in 
Presently I heard something in the near bushesand in a moment a large
porcupine came into viewI thought that hetoowas looking for water 
but nohe was evidently on his way to my campHealsohad heard the
latest rumor on the mountain topIt was highly amusing to watch his
movementsHe came teetering along in the most aimlessidiotic wayNow
he drifted off a little to the rightthen a little to the lefthis
blunt nose seemed vaguely to be feeling the airhe fumbled over the
groundtossed about by loose boulders and little hillockshis eyes
wandered stupidly aboutI was in plain view within four or five yards
of himbut he heeded me notThen he turned back a few pacesbut some
slight obstacle in his way caused him to change his mindOne thought of
a sleep walkeruncertainty was stamped upon every gesture and movement 
yet he was really drifting towards campAfter a while he struck the
well defined trailand his grayshapeless body slowly disappeared up
the slopeIn five or six minutes I overtook him shuffling along within
sight of the big rock upon which rested my blanket and lunchAs I came
up to him he depressed his tailput up his shieldand slowly pushed
off into the wild grassWhile I was at lunch I heard a soundand there
he waslooking up at me from the path a few feet away An uninvited
guest I said but come on He hesitatedand then turned aside into
the brackenhe would wait till I had finished and had gone to sleepor
had moved off 

How much less wit have such animals animals like the porcupine 
opossumskunkturtle that nature has armed against all foesthan
the animals that have no such ready made defensesand are preyed upon
by a multitude of enemies! The price paid for being shielded against all
dangerfor never feeling fear or anxietyis stupidityIf the
porcupine were as vulnerable to its enemies assaythe woodchuckit
would probably soon come to be as alert and swift of foot as that
marmot 

For an hour or morethat afternoon on the mountain topmy attention
was attracted by a peculiar continuous sound that seemed to come from
far away to the eastI queried with myself Is it the sound of some
workman in a distant valley hidden by the mountainsor is its source
nearer by me on the mountain sideI could not determineIt was not a
hammering or a grating or the filing of a sawthough it suggested such
soundsIt had a vaguedistantventriloquial characterIn the
solitude of the mountain top there was something welcome and pleasing in
itFinally I set out to try to solve the mysteryI had not gone fifty
yards from camp when I knew I was near the source of the sound 
Presently I saw a porcupine on a logand as I approached the sound
ceasedand the animal moved awayA curious kind of chant he madeor
note of wonder and surprise at my presence on the mountain or was he
calling together the clan for a midnight raid upon my camp

I made my bed that night of ferns and balsam boughs under an overhanging
rockwhere the storm that swept across the mountain just after dark
could not reach meI lay downrolled in my blanketswith a long staff
by my sidein anticipation of visits from the porcupinesIn the middle
of the night I was awakenedandlooking out of my densaw a porcupine
outlined against the starlit skyI made a thrust at him with my staff 
whenwith a grunt or grumblehe disappearedA little later I was
awakened again by the same animalor anotherwhich I repelled as
beforeAt intervals during the rest of the night they visited me in
this waymy sleep was by short stages from one porcupine to another 

These animals are great gnawersThey seem to be specially fond of
gnawing any tool or object that has been touched or used by human hands 
They would probably have gnawed my shoes or lunch basket or staff had I
lain stillA settler at the foot of the mountain told me they used to
prove very annoying to him by getting into his cellar or woodshed at
nightand indulging their ruling passion by chewing upon his
tool handles or pails or harness Kick one of them outdoors he said 
 and in half an hour he is back again In winter they usually live in
treesgnawing the bark and feeding upon the inner layerI have seen
large hemlocks quite denuded and killed in this way

THE OPOSSUM


A new track has appeared upon the snow in my neighborhood here on the
Hudson within the past few yearsIt is a strange trackand suggests
some smalldeformed human handIf the dwarfs or brownies we read of in
childhood were to walk abroad in winterthey might leave such an
imprint behind them as this 

This trackwhich we seldom see later than Decemberis made by the
opossumThis animal is evidently multiplying in the landand is
extending its range northwardTen years ago they were rarely found
hereand now they are very commonI hear that they are very abundant
and troublesome on parts of Long IslandThe hind foot of the opossum
has a sort of thumb that opposes the other toesand it is the imprint
of this member that looks so strangeThe under side of the foot is as
naked as the human handand this adds to the novel look of the track in
the snow 

Late in the fallmy hired man set a trap in a hole in hopes of catching
a skunkbut instead he caught a possum by one of its fore feetThe
poor thing was badly crippledand he kept it in a barrel for a couple
of weeks and fed itto try and make amends for the injury he had done 
Then he gave it its freedomthough the injured foot had healed but
little 

Soon after he set his trap in the same holeand to his annoyance caught
the possum againthis time by one of the hind feetHe brought the
quietuncomplaining creature to me by its prehensile tailand asked me
what should be done with or for itI concluded to make a hospital for
it in one corner of my studyI made it a nest behind a pile of
magazinesand fed and nursed it for several weeksIt never made a
soundor showed the least uneasiness or sign of sufferingthat I was
aware ofin all that timeBy day it slept curled up in its nestIf
disturbedit did notplay possum that isdid not feign sleep or
deathbut opened its mouth and grinned up at you in a sort of comical 
idiotic wayAt night it hobbled about the studyand ate the meat and
cake I had placed for itSometimes by day it would come out of the
corner and eat food under the loungeeating very much after the manner
of a pigthough not so greedilyIndeedall its motions were very
slowlike those of the skunk 

The skin of the opossum is said to be so fetid that a dog will not touch
itA dog is always suspicious of an animal that shows no fear and makes
no attempt to get out of his wayThis fetidness of the opossum is not
apparent to my sense 

After a while my patient began to be troublesome by climbing upon the
book shelves and inspecting the booksso I concluded to discharge him
from the hospitalOne night I carried him to the open door by his tail 
put him down upon the door silland told him to go forthHe hesitated 
looked back into the warm roomthen out into the winter nightthen
thought of his maimed feetand of traps in holes where unsuspecting
possums liveand could not reach a decision Come I said I have
done all I can for yougo forth and shift for yourself Slowlylike a
very old manhe climbed down out of the door and disappeared in the
darknessI have no doubt he regained his freedom with a sighIt is
highly probable thatif a trap is set in his way againhe will put his
foot in it as innocently as before 

One day in March one of my neighbors brought to me a handful of young
possumsvery youngsixteen of themlike newly born miceThe mother
had been picked up dead on the railroadkilledas so often happens to
coonsfoxesmuskratsand woodchucksby the night expressThe young
were in her poucheach clinging to its teatdeadThe young are
carried and nursed by the mothers in this curious pocket till they are
four or five weeks oldor of the size of large miceAfter this she
frequently carries them aboutclinging to various parts of her body 
some with their tails wound around hers 

The next wintertwo or more possums and a skunk took up their quarters
under my study floorIt was not altogether a happy familyJust what
their disagreements were aboutI do not knowbut the skunk evidently
tried to roast the possums outThe possums stood it better than I
couldI came heartily to wish they were all roasted outI was
beginning to devise ways and meanswhen I think the skunk took himself
offAfter thatmy only annoyance was from the quarreling of the
possums among themselvesand their ceaseless fussing around under
thereboth day and nightAt times they made sounds as if they were
scratching matches on the under side of the floorthen they seemed to
be remaking or shifting their beds from one side to the otherSometimes
I think they snored in their sleepOne nightas I was going from the
house to the studyI heard a rustling in the dry leaves and grass 
beside the pathLighting a matchI approached the spotand found one
of the possums just setting out on his night s excursionsI stooped
down and stroked his head and scratched his backbut he did not move 
he only opened his mouth a little and looked silly

WILD MICE


One of the prettiest and most abundant of our native mice is the deer
mousealso called the white footed mousea very beautiful creature 
nocturnal in his habitswith large earsand largefine eyes full of a
wildharmless lookHe is daintily markedwith white feet and a white
bellyWhen disturbed by day he is very easily capturedhaving none of
the cunning or viciousness of the common Old World mouseHe is found in
both fields and woods 

It is he whohigh in the hollow trunk of some treelays by a store of
beech nuts for winter useEvery nut is carefully shelledand the
cavity that serves as storehouse lined with grass and leavesThe
wood chopper frequently squanders this precious storeI have seen half
a peck taken from one treeas clean and white as if put up by the most
delicate hands as they wereHow long it must have taken the little
creature to collect this quantityto hull them one by oneand convey
them up to his fifth story chamber!

But the deer mice do not always carry their supplies home in this
mannerthey often hide them in the nearest convenient placeI have
known them to carry a pint or more of hickory nuts and deposit them in a
pair of boots standing in the chamber of an outhouseNear the
chestnut trees they will fill little pocket like depressions in the
ground with chestnutsin a grain field they carry the grain under
stonesunder some cover beneath cherry trees they collect great numbers
of cherry pitsHencewhen cold weather comesinstead of staying at
home like the chipmunkthey gad about hither and thither looking up
their suppliesOne may see their tracks on the snow everywhere in the
woods and fields and by the roadsideThe advantage of this way of
living is that it leads to activityand probably to sociability 


One dayon my walk in the woodsI saw at one point the mice tracks
unusually thick around a small sugar mapleIt was doubtless their
granarythey had beech nuts stored thereI ll warrantThere were two
entrances to the cavity of the tree one at the baseand one seven or
eight feet upAt the upper onewhich was only just of the size of a
mousea squirrel had been trying to break inHe had cut and chiseled
the solid wood to the depth of nearly an inchand his chips strewed
the snow all aboutHe knew what was in thereand the mice knew that he
knewhence their apparent consternationThey had rushed wildly about
over the snowandI doubt nothad given the piratical red squirrel a
piece of their mindsA few yards away the mice had a hole down into the
snowwhich perhaps led to some snug den under the groundHither they
may have been slyly removing their stores while the squirrel was at work
with his back turnedOne more night and he would effect an entrance 
what a good joke upon him if he found the cavity empty! These native
miceI imaginehave to take many precautions to prevent their winter
stores being plundered by the squirrelswho liveas it werefrom hand
to mouth 

The wild mice are fond of bees and of honeyand they apparently like
nothing better than to be allowed to take up their quarters in winter in
some vacant space in a hive of beesA chamber just over the bees seems
to be preferredas here they get the benefit of the warmth generated by
the insectsOne very cold winter I wrapped up one of my hives with a
shawlBefore long I noticed that the shawl was beginning to have a very
torn and tattered appearanceOn examinationI found that a native
mouse had established itself in the top of the hiveand had levied a
ruinous tax upon the shawl to make itself a nestNever was a fabric
more completely reduced into its original elements than were large
sections of that shawlIt was a masterly piece of analysisThe work of
the wheel and the loom was exactly reversedand what was once shawl was
now the finest and softest of wool 

The white footed mouse is much more common along the fences and in the
woods than one would suspectOne winter day I set a mouse trapthe
kind known as the delusion trapbeneath some ledges in the edge of the
woodsto determine what species of mouse was most active at this
seasonThe snow fell so deeply that I did not visit my trap for two or
three weeksWhen I did soit was literally packed full of white footed
miceThere were seven in alland not room for anotherOur woods are
full of these little creaturesand they appear to have a happysocial
time of iteven in the severest wintersTheir little tunnels under the
snow and their hurried leaps upon its surface may be noted everywhere 
They link tree and stumpor rock and treeby their pretty trailsThey
evidently travel for adventure and to hear the newsas well as for
foodThey know that foxes and owls are aboutand they keep pretty
close to coverWhen they cross an exposed placethey do it hurriedly 

The field or meadow mice doubtless welcome the snowThey can now come
out of their dens in the ground or beneath the flat stones and lead a
more free and active lifeThe snow is their friendIt keeps off the
coldand it shields their movements from the eyes of their enemiesthe
owlshawksand foxesNow they can venture abroad from their retreats
without fearThey make little tunnels and roadways everywhere over the
surface of the groundThey build winter houses under the great drifts 
They found little mouse colonies in places where they have never been in
summerThe conditions of life with them are entirely changedThey can
get at the roots of the grassesor the various herbs and seeds they
feed uponas well as in the snowless seasonsand without exposure to
their enemies 

I fancy they have great times there beneath the driftsMaybe they have
their picnics and holidays then as we have ours in summerWhen the
drifts disappear in springyou may often see where they have had their
little encampmentsa few square yards of the pasture or meadow bottom
will look as if a map had been traced upon ittunnels and highways
running and winding in every direction and connecting the nests of dry
grasswhich might stand for the cities and towns on the mapThese
runways are smooth and round like pipesand only a little larger than
the bodies of the miceI think it is only the meadow field mouse that
lives in this way beneath the snow 

I met one of these mice in my travels one day under peculiar conditions 
He was on his travels alsoand we met in the middle of a mountain lake 
I was casting my fly therewhen I sawjust sketched or etched upon the
glassy surfacea delicate V shaped figurethe point of which reached
about to the middle of the lakewhile the two sidesas they diverged 
faded out toward the shoreI saw the point of this V was being slowly
pushed across the lakeI drew near in my boatand beheld a little
mouse swimming vigorously for the opposite shoreHis little legs
appeared like swiftly revolving wheels beneath himAs I came nearhe
dived under the water to escape mebut came up again like a cork and
just as quicklyIt was laughable to see him repeatedly duck beneath the
surface and pop back again in a twinklingHe could not keep under water
more than a second or twoPresently I reached him my oarwhen he ran
up it and into the palm of my handwhere he sat for some time and
arranged his fur and warmed himselfHe did not show the slightest fear 
It was probably the first time he had ever shaken hands with a human
beingHe had doubtless lived all his life in the woodsand was
strangely unsophisticatedHow his little round eyes did shineand how
he sniffed me to find out if I was more dangerous than I appeared to his
sight!

After a while I put him down in the bottom of the boat and resumed my
fishingBut it was not long before he became very restlessand
evidently wanted to go about his businessHe would climb up to the edge
of the boat and peer down into the waterFinally he could brook the
delay no longer and plunged boldly overboardbut he had either changed
his mind or lost his reckoningfor he started back in the direction
from which he had comeand the last I saw of him he was a mere speck
vanishing in the shadows near the shore 

Later on I saw another mousewhile we were at work in the fieldsthat
interested me alsoThis one was our native white footed mouseWe
disturbed the mother with her young in her nestand she rushed out with
her little ones clinging to her teatsA curious spectacle she
presented as she rushed alongas if slit and torn into ragsHer pace
was so hurried that two of the young could not keep their hold and were
left in the weedsWe remained quietand presently the mother came back
looking for themWhen she had found oneshe seized it as a cat seizes
her kitten and made off with itIn a moment or two she came back and
found the other one and carried it awayI was curious to see if the
young would take hold of her teats again as at firstand be dragged
away in that mannerbut they did notIt would be interesting to know
if they seize hold of their mother by instinct when danger threatensor
if they simply retain the hold which they already haveI believe the
flight of the family always takes place in this manner with this species
of mouse 

I suspect that our white footed mouse is capable of lending a hand to a
fellow in distressat leastthe following incident looks like itOne
season they overran my cabin in the woodsand gave me a good deal of
annoyanceso much so that I tried trapping themusing the ordinary
circular trap with four or five holes and wire springsOne night I
heard the trap spring in the attic over my headfollowed by the kicking
and straggling of the mouseThis continued for a few momentswhen all
was still There I said that mouse is dead Presently the rattling
of the trap recommencedand continued so long at short intervals that
going to sleep was out of the questionI fancied the mouse was too
strong for the trapso I went upstairs to investigateThe captive was
deadsure enoughand I was more puzzled than everOn examining him
closelyI found the fur on his back was wet and much rumpledI
concludedthereforethat his companions had seized him thereand had
been tugging away at him to drag him out of the trapcausing the
rattling I had heardNo other explanation seems probable 


The least mammal in our woods is the little mouse like shrewscarcely
more than three inches longtail and allAnd it is the shyest and
least knownOne gets a glimpse of it only at rare intervalswhile
sitting or standing motionless in the woodsThere is a slight rustle
under the leavesand you may see a tiny form dart across a little
opening in the leafy carpetIts one dread seems to be exposure to the
lightIf it were watched and waited for by a hundred enemiesit could
hardly be more hurried and cautious in its movementsAnd when once
captured and fairly exposed to the lightit soon diesprobably of
frightOne night in midsummerwhen I was camping in the woodsone of
them got into an empty tin pail and was dead in the morningA teacher
caught one in a delusion trapand attempted to take it to her school 
to show her childrenbut it was dead when she got thereIn winter it
makes little tunnels under the snow in the woodsnow and then coming to
the surfaceandafter a few jumpsdiving under the snow againIts
tracks are like the most delicate stitchingI have never found its nest
or seen its youngLike all the shrewsit lives mainly upon worms and
insects 


The track of one of our native mice we do not see upon the snow that
of the jumping mouseSo far as I knowit is the only one of our mice
that hibernatesIt is much more rare than its cousin the deer mouseor
white footed mouseand I have never known it to be found in barns or
dwellingsI think I have heard it called the kangaroo mousebecause of
its form and its manner of runningwhich is in long leapsIts fore
legs are small and shortand its hind legs long and strongIt bounds
alongleaping two or more feet at a timeI used to see it when a boy 
but have not met with one for many years 

One summera boy who lives in Dutchess Countyacross the Hudson from
my housecaught four of these mice in a wire traptwo males and two
femalesThe boy said that when he picked up the trap the two males fell
deadfrom fright he thoughtOne of the females died in Octoberbut
the other lived and began hibernating early in NovemberHe took it to
his teacher in New Yorkwho kept it through the winterShe made a
pocket for it in a woolen sockbut it was not suited with itfor in
January it woke up and made itself a neat little blanket from the wool
which it nibbled from the sockIn this it rolled itself and went to
sleep againA week or two later I was at the schooland the teacher
showed me her sleeping mouseIt was rolled up in a ballwith its tail
wrapped about its headI held it in the palm of my handIt seemed
almost as cold as a dead mouseand I could not see it breatheIt was
carefully put back in its blanket 

Not long after thisa small house mouse was put in the box with it It
was the tiniest little mouse says Miss Burt you ever sawIt cuddled
in with the hibernatorwho got up at once and took care of this baby 
The baby struck out independently and burrowed in the sandand stole
some of the wool and feathers from hibernator to line his own nestBut
the jumping mouse went in with himenlarged the nestand cuddled down
to himThey were great friendsBut the baby smelled dreadfullyas all
house mice doand I took him outThen the hibernator curled up again
and went into winter quarters 

 When the warm weather came onshe uncurled and ate and drankShe
preferred pecan nuts and shredded wheat biscuitand ate cornI tried
to tame herI took a strong feather and played with herAt first she
resisted and was frightenedbut after a while shestood it ' and would
even eat and clean herself while I scratched her with this featherBut
she was always terribly frightenedwhen coming out of her day s sleep 
if I began to play with herAfter being thoroughly waked upshe did
not mind itShe would let me smooth her with my fingerand she would
smell of my finger and go on eatingkeeping an eye outThree times she
had a perfect fit of frightlying on her backand kicking and
trembling violentlyOn these occasions she made a scuttling noise or
cryand I thought each time she would dieso I grew more and more
cautious about meddling with herThere was one interesting thing about
it she rose from these fits and ate heartilyand cleaned herself
with great unconcernI was tempted to believe that she shammed dying 

 The most interesting thing I ever saw her do was to climb up on her
glass of watersit on the rimand put both little paws down and scoop
up a big double handful of water and wash her face and headShe made
her face very wetjust like a person washing his faceShe ate
sunflower seedsand often kept one eye shut a long time on first waking
upAfter the apple blossoms cameI kept her box supplied with flowers 
such as apple blossomscherrysprucemapleand so onAlso I kept
her box disinfectedwith plenty of goodfresh country dirtBut she
stuck to the old wool and feathersand the little piano duster

The mouse continued hibernating at intervals till MayOne dampchilly
morning Miss Burt thought she would add to her pet s coveringsthe
creature seemed so cold to the touch Little by littlemuch of her
bedding of wool had been removedalthough she had a pretty good blanket
of it leftand the feather duster over herwhich she appropriated long
agoSo I resolved to carry some bits of flannel to school andwhen I
went to her box to give her the extra clothingagain found her as you
saw herrolled up in a ballI covered her carefullywrapped her all
upand put her backLater in the day I peeped inand she was awake 
In the afternoon I took her out in her little blanket and looked at her 
She was asleepbut started upandseeing herself out of her boxput
up her little paw in frightShe trembled violentlyand I hastily
returned her to her boxbut before I could cover her she fell back dead
of fright Miss Burt adds I have had her put in alcoholOne tiny paw
is raised imploringlysuggestive of the sensitive nerves that caused
her death

GLIMPSES OF WILD LIFE


So fond am I of seeing Nature reassert herself that I even found some
compensation in the loss of my chickens that bright November night when
some wild creaturecoon or foxswept two of them out of the
evergreensand their squawking as they were hurried across the lawn
called me from my bed to shout good by after themIt gave a new
interest to the hen roostthis sudden incursion of wild natureI feel
bound to caution the boys about disturbing the wild rabbits that in
summer breed in my currant patchand in autumn seek refuge under my
study floorThe occasional glimpses I get of them about the lawn in the
dusktheir cotton tails twinkling in the dimnessafford me a genuine
pleasureI have seen the time when I would go a good way to shoot a
partridgebut I would not have killedif I couldthe one that started
out of the vines that cover my rustic porchas I approached that side
of the house one autumn morningHow much of the woodsand of the
untamable spirit of wild natureshe brought to my very door! It was
tonic and exhilarating to see her whirl away toward the vineyardI also
owe a moment s pleasure to the gray squirrel thatfinding my
summer house in the line of his travels one summer dayran through it
and almost over my feet as I sat idling with a book 

I am sure my power of digestion was improved that cold winter morning
whenjust as we were sitting down to breakfast about sunrisea red fox
loped along in front of the windowlooking neither to the right nor to
the leftand disappeared amid the currant bushesWhat of the wild and
the cunning did he not bring! His graceful form and motion were in my
mind s eye all dayWhen you have seen a fox loping along in that way 
you have seen the poetry there is in the canine tribeIt is to the eye
what a flowing measure is to the mindso easyso buoyantthe furry
creature drifting along like a large red thistledownor like a plume
borne by the windIt is something to remember with pleasurethat a
muskrat sought my door one December night when a cold wave was swooping
down upon usWas he seeking shelteror had he lost his reckoning The
dogs cornered him in the very doorwayand set up a great hubbubIn the
darknessthinking it was a catI put my hand down to feel itThe
creature skipped to the other corner of the doorwayhitting my hand
with its coldrope like tailLighting a matchI had a glimpse of him
sitting up on his haunches like a woodchuckconfronting his enemiesI
rushed in for the lanternwith the hope of capturing him alivebut
before I returnedthe dogsgrowing boldhad finished him 

I have had but one call from a coonthat I am aware ofand I fear we
did not treat him with due hospitalityHe took up his quarters for the
day in a Norway sprucethe branches of which nearly brushed the house 
I had noticed that the dog was very curious about that tree all the
afternoonAfter dinner his curiosity culminated in repeated loud and
confident barkingThen I began an investigationexpecting to find a
strange cator at most a red squirrelBut a moment s scrutiny revealed
his coonshipThen how to capture him became the problemA long pole
was procuredand I sought to dislodge him from his holdThe skill with
which he maintained himself amid the branches excited our admiration 
But after a time he dropped lightly to the groundnot in the least
disconcertedand at once on his guard against both man and beastThe
dog was a cowardand dared not face himWhen the coon s attention was
divertedthe dog would rush inthen one of us would attempt to seize
the coon s tailbut he faced about so quicklyhis black eyes gleaming 
that the hand was timid about seizing himBut finally in his
skirmishing with the dog I caught him by the tailand bore him safely
to an open flour barreland he was our prisoner 

Much amusement my little boy and I anticipated with himHe partook of
food that same dayand on the second day would eat the chestnuts in our
presenceNever did he show the slightest fear of us or of anythingbut
he was unwearied in his efforts to regain his freedomAfter a few days
we put a strap upon his neck and kept him tethered by a chainBut in
the nightby dint of some hocus pocushe got the chain unsnapped and
made offand he is nowI trusta patriarch of his tribewearing a
leather necktie 

The skunk visits every farm sooner or laterOne night I came near
shaking hands with one on my very door stoneI thought it was the cat 
and put down my hand to stroke itwhen the creatureprobably
appreciating my mistakemoved off up the bankrevealing to me the
white stripe on its body and the kind of cat I had salutedThe skunk is
not easily ruffledand seems to employ excellent judgment in the use of
its terrible weapon 

Several times I have had calls from woodchucksOne looked in at the
open door of my study one dayandafter sniffing a whileand not
liking the smell of such clover as I was compelled to nibble there 
moved on to better pasturesAnother one invaded the kitchen door while
we were at dinnerThe dogs promptly challenged himand there was a
lively scrimmage upon the door stoneI thought the dogs were fighting 
and rushed to part themThe incident broke in upon the drowsy summer
noonas did the appearance of the muskrat upon the frigid December
night 

The woodchuck episode that afforded us the most amusement occurred one
midsummerWe were at work in a newly planted vineyardwhen the man
with the cultivator sawa few yards in front of himsome large gray
object that at first puzzled himHe approached itand found it to be
an old woodchuck with a young one in her mouthShe was carrying her
kitten as does a catby the nape of the neckEvidently she was moving
her family to pastures newAs the man was in the line of her marchshe
stopped and considered what was to be doneHe called to meand I
approached slowlyAs the mother saw me closing in on her flankshe was
suddenly seized with a panicanddropping her youngshe fled
precipitately for the cover of a large pile of grape posts some ten or
twelve rods distantWe pursued hotlyand overhauled her as she was
within one jump of the house of refugeTaking her by the tailI
carried her back to her babybut she heeded it notIt was only her own
bacon now that she was solicitous aboutThe young one remained where he
had been droppedkeeping up a bravereassuring whistle that was in
ludicrous contrast to his exposed and helpless conditionHe was the
smallest woodchuck I had ever seennot much larger than a large rat 
His head and shoulders were so large in proportion to the body as to
give him a comical lookHe could not walk about yetand had never
before been above groundEvery moment or two he would whistle cheerily 
as the old one does when safe in his den with the farm dog fiercely
baying outside 

We took the youngster homeand my little boy was delighted over the
prospect of a tame woodchuckNot till the next day would he eatThen 
getting a taste of the milkhe clutched the spoon that held it with
great eagernessand sucked away like a little pigWe were all
immensely diverted by himHe ate eagerlygrew rapidlyand was soon
able to run about 

As the old one had been killedwe became curious as to the fate of the
rest of her familyfor no doubt there were moreHad she moved themor
had we intercepted her on her first trip We knew where the old den was 
but not the newSo we would keep a lookoutNear the end of the week 
on passing by the old denthere were three young ones creeping about a
few feet from its mouthThey were starved outand had come forth to
see what could be foundWe captured them alland the young family was
again unitedHow these poorhalf famished creatures did lay hold of
the spoon when they got a taste of the milk! One could not help
laughingTheir little shining black paws were so handy and so smooth 
they seemed as if encased in kid glovesThe captives throve well upon
milkand then upon milk and clover 

But after the novelty of the thing had worn offthe boy found he had
incumbered himself with serious duties in assuming the position of
foster mother to this large familyso he gave them all away but one 
the first one capturedwhich had outstripped all the others in growth 
This soon became a very amusing petbut he always protested when
handledand always objected to confinementI should mention that the
cat had a kitten about the age of the chuckandas she had more milk
than the kitten could dispose ofthe chuckwhen we first got himwas
often placed in the nest with the kittenand was regarded by the cat as
tenderly as her ownand allowed to nurse freelyThus a friendship
sprang up between the kitten and the woodchuckwhich lasted as long as
the latter livedThey would play together precisely like two
kittens clinch and tumble about and roll upon the grass in a very
amusing wayFinally the woodchuck took up his abode under the floor of
the kitchenand gradually relapsed into a half wild stateHe would
permit no familiarities from any one save the kittenbut each day they
would have a turn or two at their old games of rough and tumbleThe
chuck was now over half grownand procured his own livingOne day the
dogwho had all along looked upon him with a jealous eyeencountered
him too far from coverand his career ended then and there 

In July the woodchuck was forgotten in our interest in a little gray
rabbit which we found nearly famishedIt was so small that it could sit
in the hollow of one s handSome accident had probably befallen its
motherThe tiny creature looked spiritless and forlornWe had to force
the milk into its mouthBut in a day or two it began to reviveand
would lap the milk eagerlySoon it took to grass and cloverand then
to nibbling sweet apples and early pearsIt grew rapidlyand was one
of the softest and most harmless looking pets I had ever seenFor a
month or more the little rabbit was the only company I hadand it
helped to beguile the time immenselyIn coming in from the field or
from my workI seldom failed to bring it a handful of red clover
blossomsof which it became very fondOne day it fell slyly to licking
my handand I discovered it wanted saltI would then moisten my
fingersdip them into the saltand offer them to the rabbitHow
rapidly the delicate little tongue would play upon themdarting out to
the right and left of the large front incisorsthe slender paws being
pressed against my hand as if to detain it!

But the rabbit proved really untamableits wild nature could not be
overcomeIn its large box cage or prisonwhere it could see nothing
but the tree above itit was tameand would at times frisk playfully
about my hand and strike it gently with its forefeetbut the moment it
was liberated in a roomor let down in the grass with a string about
its neckall its wild nature came forthIn the room it would run and
hidein the open it would make desperate efforts to escapeand leap
and bound as you drew in the string that held itAt nighttooit
never failed to try to make its escape from the cageand finallywhen
two thirds grownit succeededand we saw it no more

A LIFE OF FEAR


As I sat looking from my window the other morning upon a red squirrel
gathering nuts from a small hickoryand storing them up in his den in
the bankI was forcibly reminded of the state of constant fear and
apprehension in which the wild creatures liveand I tried to picture to
myself what life would be to meor to any of ushedged about by so
many dangersreal or imaginary 

The squirrel would shoot up the treemaking only a brown streak from
the bottom to the topwould seize his nut and rush down again in the
most hurried mannerHalf way to his denwhich was not over three rods
distanthe would rush up the trunk of another tree for a few yards to
make an observationNo danger being nearhe would dive into his den
and reappear again in a twinkling 

Returning for another nuthe would mount the second tree again for
another observationSatisfied that the coast was clearhe would spin
along the top of the ground to the tree that bore the nutsshoot up it
as beforeseize the fruitand then back again to his retreat 

Never did he fail during the half hour or more that I watched him to
take an observation on his way both to and from his nestIt wassnatch
and runwith himSomething seemed to say to him all the time Look
out! look out! The cat! The hawk! The owl! The boy with the
gun! 

It was a bleak December morningthe first fine flakes of a cold 
driving snowstorm were just beginning to sift downand the squirrel was
eager to finish harvesting his nuts in timeIt was quite touching to
see how hurried and anxious and nervous he wasI felt like going out
and lending a handThe nuts were smallpoor pig nutsand I thought of
all the gnawing he would have to do to get at the scanty meat they held 
My little boy once took pity on a squirrel that lived in the wall near
the gateand cracked the nuts for himand put them upon a small board
shelf in the tree where he could sit and eat them at his ease 


The red squirrel is not so provident as the chipmunkHe lays up stores
irregularlyby fits and startshe never has enough put up to carry him
over the winterhence he is more or less active all the seasonLong
before the December snowthe chipmunk has for days been making hourly
trips to his den with full pockets of nuts or corn or buckwheattill
his bin holds enough to carry him through to AprilHe need notand I
believe does notset foot out of doors during the whole winterBut the
red squirrel trusts more to luck 

As alert and watchful as the red squirrel ishe is frequently caught by
the catMy Nigas black as ebonyknows well the taste of his fleshI
have known him to be caught by the black snake and successfully
swallowedThe snakeno doubtlay in ambush for him 

This fearthis ever present source of danger of the wild creatureswe
know little aboutProbably the only person in the civilized countries
who is no better off than the animals in this respect is the Czar of
RussiaHe would not even dare gather nuts as openly as my squirrelA
blacker and more terrible cat than Nig would be lying in wait for him
and would make a meal of himThe early settlers in this country must
have experienced something of this dread of apprehension from the
IndiansMany African tribes now live in the same state of constant fear
of the slave catchers or of other hostile tribesOur ancestorsback in
prehistoric timesmust have known fear as a constant feelingHence
the prominence of fear in infants and children when compared with the
youth or the grown personBabies are nearly always afraid of strangers 

In the domestic animals alsofear is much more active in the young than
in the oldNearly every farm boy has seen a calf but a day or two old 
which its mother has secreted in the woods or in a remote fieldcharge
upon him furiously with a wild bleatwhen first discoveredAfter this
first ebullition of fearit usually settles down into the tame humdrum
of its bovine elders 

Eternal vigilance is the price of life with most of the wild creatures 
There is only one among them whose wildness I cannot understandand
that is the common water turtleWhy is this creature so fearful What
are its enemies I know of nothing that preys upon itYet see how
watchful and suspicious these turtles are as they sun themselves upon a
log or a rockWhile you are yet many yards away from themthey slide
down into the water and are gone 

The land turtleon the other handshows scarcely a trace of fearHe
will indeed pause in his walk when you are very near himbut he will
not retreat into his shell till you have poked him with your foot or
your caneHe appears to have no enemiesbut the little spotted water
turtle is as shy as if he were the delicate tidbit that every creature
was searching forI did once find one which a fox had dug out of the
mud in winterand carried a few rods and dropped on the snowas if he
had found he had no use for it 

One can understand the fearlessness of the skunkNearly every creature
but the farm dog yields to him the right of wayAll dread his terrible
weaponIf you meet one in your walk in the twilight fieldsthe chances
are that you will turn out for himnot he for youHe may even pursue
youjust for the fun of seeing you runHe comes waltzing toward you 
apparently in the most hilarious spirits 

The coon is probably the most courageous creature among our familiar
wild animalsWho ever saw a coon show the white feather He will face
any odds with perfect composureI have seen a coon upon the ground 
beset by four men and two dogsand never for a moment losing his
presence of mindor showing a sign of fearThe raccoon is clear grit 

The fox is a very wild and suspicious creaturebut curiously enough 
when you suddenly come face to face with himwhen he is held by a trap 
or driven by the houndhis expression is not that of fearbut of
shame and guiltHe seems to diminish in size and to be overwhelmed with
humiliationDoes he know himself to be an old thiefand is that the
reason of his embarrassment The fox has no enemies but manand when he
is fairly outwitted he looks the shame he evidently feels 

In the heart of the rabbit fear constantly abidesHow her eyes
protrude! She can see back and forward and on all sides as well as a
birdThe fox is after herthe owls are after herthe gunners are
after herand she has no defense but her speedShe always keeps well
to coverThe northern hare keeps in the thickest brushIf the hare or
rabbit crosses a broad open exposure it does so hurriedlylike a mouse
when it crosses the roadThe mouse is in danger of being pounced upon
by a hawkand the hare or rabbit by the snowy owlor else the great
horned owl 

A friend of mine was following one morning a fresh rabbit track through
an open fieldSuddenly the track came to an endas if the creature had
taken wings as it had after an unpleasant fashionThereon either
side of its last foot imprintwere several parallel lines in the snow 
made by the wings of the great owl that had swooped down and carried it
offWhat a little tragedy was seen written there upon the whiteeven
surface of the field!

The rabbit has not much witOncewhen a boyI saw one that had been
recently caughtliberated in an open field in the presence of a dog
that was being held a few yards awayThe poor thing lost all presence
of mindand was quickly caught by the clumsy dog 

A hunter once saw a hare running upon the ice along the shore of one of
the Rangeley lakesPresently a lynx appeared in hot pursuitas soon as
the hare found it was being pursuedit began to circlefoolish thing 
This gave the lynx greatly the advantageas it could follow in a much
smaller circleSoon the hare was run down and seized 

I saw a similar experiment tried with a red squirrel with quite opposite
resultsThe boy who had caught the squirrel in his wire trap had a very
bright and nimble dog about the size of a foxthat seemed to be very
sure he could catch a red squirrel under any circumstances if only the
trees were out of the waySo the boy went to the middle of an open
field with his caged squirrelthe dogwho seemed to know what was up 
dancing and jumping about himIt was in midwinterthe snow had a firm
crust that held boy and dog alikeThe dog was drawn back a few yards
and the squirrel liberated 

Then began one of the most exciting races I have witnessed for a long
timeIt was impossible for the lookers on not to be convulsed with
laughterthough neither dog nor squirrel seemed to regard the matter as
much of a jokeThe squirrel had all his wits about himand kept them
ready for instant useHe did not show the slightest confusionHe was
no match for the dog in fair runningand he discovered this fact in
less than three secondshe must winif at allby strategyNot a
straight course for the nearest treebut a zigzag courseyeaa double
or treble zigzag courseEvery instant the dog was sure the squirrel was
hisand every instant he was disappointedIt was incredible and
bewildering to himThe squirrel dodged this way and thatThe dog
looked astonished and vexedThen the squirrel issued from between his
enemy s hind legs and made three jumps towards the woods before he was
discoveredOur sides ached with laughtercruel as it may seem 

It was evident the squirrel would winThe dog seemed to redouble his
effortsHe would overshoot the gameor shoot by it to the right or
leftThe squirrel was the smaller craftand could out tack him
easilyOne more leap and the squirrel was up a treeand the dog was
overwhelmed with confusion and disgustHe could not believe his senses 
 Not catch a squirrel in such a field as that Go toI will have him
yet!and he bounded up the tree as high as one s headand then bit the
bark of it in his anger and chagrin 

The boy says his dog has never bragged since about catching red
squirrelsif only the trees were out of reach! 

When any of the winged creatures are engaged in a life and death race in
that wayor in any other racethe tactics of the squirrel do not work 
the pursuer never overshoots nor shoots by his markThe flight of the
two is timed as if they were parts of one wholeA hawk will pursue a
sparrow or a robin through a zigzag course and not lose a stroke or half
a stroke of the wing by reason of any darting to the right or leftThe
clue is held with fatal precisionNo matter how quickly nor how often
the sparrow or the finch changes its courseits enemy changes 
simultaneouslyas if every move was known to it from the first 

The same thing may be noticed among the birds in their love chasings 
the pursuer seems to know perfectly the mind of the pursuedThis
concert of action among birds is very curiousWhen they are on the
alerta flock of sparrowsor pigeonsor cedar birdsor snow
buntingsor blackbirdswill all take flight as if there were but one
birdinstead of a hundredThe same impulse seizes every individual
bird at the same instantas if they were sprung by electricity 

Or when a flock of birds is in flightit is still one bodyone will 
it will riseor circleor swoop with a unity that is truly
astonishing 

A flock of snow buntings will perform their aerial evolutions with a
precision that the best trained soldiery cannot equalHave the birds an
extra sense which we have not A brood of young partridges in the woods
will start up like an explosionevery brown particle and fragment
hurled into the air at the same instantWithout word or signalhow is
it done
